operation of structural violence forces us to ask questions about how and why we tolerate it questions which often have painful answers for the privileged elite who unconsciously support it A final question of this section is how and why we allow ourselves to be so oblivious to structural violence Susan Opotow offers an intriguing set of answers in her article Social Injustice She argues that our normal perceptualcognitive processes divide people into ingroups and outgroups Those outside our group lie outside our scope of justice Injustice that would be instantaneously confronted if it occurred to someone we love or know is barely noticed if it occurs to strangers or those who are invisible or irrelevant We do not seem to be able to open our minds and our hearts to everyone so we draw conceptual lines between those who are in and out of our moral circle Those who fall outside are morally excluded and become either invisible or demeaned in some way so that we do not have to acknowledge the injustice they suffer Moral exclusion is a human failing but Opotow argues convincingly that it is an outcome of everyday social cognition To reduce its nefarious effects we must be vigilant in noticing and listening to oppressed invisible outsiders Inclusionary thinking can be fostered by relationships communication and appreciation of diversity Like Opotow all the authors in this section point out that structural violence is not inevitable if we become aware of its operation and build systematic ways to mitigate its effects Learning about structural violence may be discouraging overwhelming or maddening but these papers encourage us to step beyond guilt and anger and begin to think about how to reduce structural violence All the authors in this section note that the same structures such as global communication and normal social cognition which feed structural violence can also be used to empower citizens to reduce it In the long run reducing structural violence by reclaiming neighborhoods demanding social justice and living wages providing prenatal care alleviating sexism and celebrating local cultures will be our most surefooted path to building lasting peace ScheperHughes 4 ScheperHughes 4 Prof of Anthropology  CalBerkely Prof of Anthropology  UPenn Nancy and Philippe Introduction Making Sense of Violence in Violence in War and Peace pg 1922This large and at first sight messy Part VII is central to this anthologys thesis It encompasses everything from the routinized bureaucratized and utterly banal violence of children dying of hunger and maternal despair in Northeast Brazil ScheperHughes Chapter 33 to elderly African Americans dying of heat stroke in Mayor Dalys version of US apartheid in Chicagos South Side Klinenberg Chapter 38 to the racialized class hatred expressed by British Victorians in their olfactory disgust of the smelly working classes Orwell Chapter 36 In these readings violence is located in the symbolic and social structures that overdetermine and allow the criminalized drug addictions interpersonal bloodshed and racially patterned incarcerations that characterize the US inner city to be normalized Bourgois Chapter 37 and Wacquant Chapter 39 Violence It also takes the form of class racial political selfhatred and adolescent selfdestruction Quesada Chapter 35 as well as of useless ie  preventable rawly embodied physical suffering and death Farmer Chapter 34  Absolutely central to our approach is a blurring of categories and distinctions between wartime and peacetime violence Close attention to the little violences produced in the structures habituses and mentalites of everyday life shifts our attention to pathologies of class race and gender inequality More important it interrupts the voyeuristic tendencies of violence studies that risk publicly humiliating the powerless who are often forced into complicity with social and individual pathologies of power because suffering is often a solvent of human integrity and dignity Thus in this anthology we are positing a violence continuum comprised of a multitude of small wars and invisible genocides see also Scheper Hughes 1996 1997 2000b conducted in the normative social spaces of public schools clinics emergency rooms hospital wards nursing homes courtrooms public registry offices prisons detention centers and public morgues The violence continuum also refers to the ease with which humans are capable of reducing the socially vulnerable into expendable nonpersons and assuming the license  even the duty  to kill maim or soulmurder We realize that in referring to a violence and a genocide continuum we are flying in the face of a tradition of genocide studies that argues for the absolute uniqueness of the Jewish Holocaust and for vigilance with respect to restricted purist use of the term genocide itself see Kuper 1985 Chaulk 1999 Fein 1990 Chorbajian 1999 But we hold an opposing and alternative view that to the contrary it is absolutely necessary to make just such existential leaps in purposefully linking violent acts in normal times to those of abnormal times Hence the title of our volume Violence in War and in Peace If as we concede there is a moral risk in overextending the concept of genocide into spaces and corners of everyday life where we might not ordinarily think to find it and there is an even greater risk lies in failing to sensitize ourselves in misrecognizing to protogenocidal practices and sentiments daily enacted as normative behavior by ordinary goodenough citizens Peacetime crimes such as prison construction sold as economic development to impoverished communities in the mountains and deserts of California or the evolution of the criminal industrial complex into the latest peculiar institution for managing race relations in the United States Waquant Chapter 39 constitute the small wars and invisible genocides to which we refer This applies to African American and Latino youth mortality statistics in Oakland California Baltimore Washington DC and New York City These are invisible genocides not because they are secreted away or hidden from view but quite the opposite  As Wittgenstein observed the things that are hardest to perceive are those which are right before our eyes and therefore taken for granted In this regard Bourdieus partial and unfinished theory of violence see Chapters 32 and 42 as well as his concept of misrecognition is crucial to our task By including the normative everyday forms of violence hidden in the minutiae of normal social practices  in the architecture of homes in gender relations in communal work in the exchange of gifts and so forth  Bourdieu forces us to We must reconsider the broader meanings and status of violence especially the links between the violence of everyday life and explicit political terror and state repression Similarly Basaglias notion of peacetime crimes  crimini di pace  imagines a direct relationship between wartime and peacetime violence Peacetime crimes suggests the possibility that war crimes are merely ordinary everyday crimes of public consent applied systematically and dramatically in the extreme context of war Consider the parallel uses of rape during peacetime and wartime or the family resemblances between the legalized violence of US immigration and naturalization border raids on illegal aliens versus the US government engineered genocide in 1938 known as the Cherokee Trail of Tears Peacetime crimes suggests that everyday forms of state violence make a certain kind of domestic peace possible  Internal stability is purchased with the currency of peacetime crimes many of which take the form of professionally applied strangleholds Everyday forms of state violence during peacetime makes a certain kind of domestic peace possible It is an easytoidentify peacetime crime that is usually maintained as a public secret by the government and by a scared or apathetic populace Most subtly but no less politically or structurally the phenomenal growth in the United States of a new military postindustrial prison industrial complex has taken place in the absence of broadbased opposition let alone collective acts of civil disobedience The public consensus is based primarily on a new mobilization of an old fear of the mob the mugger the rapist the Black man theundeserving poor How many public executions of mentally deficient prisoners in the United States are needed to make life feel more secure for the affluent What can it possibly mean when incarceration becomes the normative socializing experience for ethnic minority youth in a society ie over 33 percent of young African American men Prison Watch 2002  In the end it is essential that we recognize the existence of a genocidal capacity among otherwise goodenough humans and that we need to exercise a defensive hypervigilance to the less dramatic permitted and even rewarded everyday acts of violence that render participation in genocideeal acts and policies possible under adverse political or economic conditions perhaps more easily than we would like to recognize Under the violence continuum we include therefore all expressions of radical social exclusion and dehumanization depersonalization pseudospeciation and reification which normalize atrocious behavior and violence toward others  The CJS controls our discourse via criminalization forcing our discussions to collapse into meaningless paternalism  debate needs to focus on deconstructing it in order to expose oppressionArmstrong 13 Armstrong Sarah Capacity as Philosophy A Review of Richard Lippkes The Ethics of Plea Bargaining June 4 2013 Available at SSRN httpsssrncomabstract2274362 or httpdxdoiorg102139ssrn2274362While I object to the casual way in which poverty is connected to crime I also want to point out that in making this move another premise is being established which also requires scrutiny This is the implied claim that it is crime which creates demand for criminal justice services Whether or not we agree that all of the behaviour defined as crime is worthy of this status there is no doubt in Lippkes book that it is the individual behaviour fairly or not labelled of criminals that determines the workload volumes of criminal justice actors However as selfevidently logical as this connection may seem it is also a selfserving rationalization of criminal justice systems to model the problem of crime as an external phenomenon like hurricanes or cancer rates rather than one in which they are directly complicit Criminologists have long challenged this premise and increasingly are showing how criminal justice agencies not only define the boundaries of but also manufacture their own clientele30 Through arrest and prosecution decisions sentence recommendations enforcement of violations of probation and designations of at risk youth criminal justice actors make choices facilitated by definitions of crime and rules governing punishment about what is or is not criminally actionable behaviour These choices are what generates caseload pressures which require relief through the kinds of safety valves listed above Empirical knowledge of the world which Lippke eyes for reform thus belies the conceptualisation of crime as an external phenomenon which we can prepare for but are largely uninvolved in causing The ethical challenge is not merely at the level of the rules but at the level of their implementation Lippkes proposal of reform understands this in that it proposes an alternative system which would regulate the behaviour of criminal justice actors involved in charge adjudication but then presumes that the world outside the front door of justice is largely beyond the control and jurisdiction of these actors I argue this is a function of how crime causation is conceived and the consequent connection made between it and social inequality Rather than social deprivation as a cause of crime there is more evidence for the claim that social deprivation is a cause of criminal justice intervention The activities of the poor are more likely to be policed by the state than the activities of those who are better off31 Under aged drinking on the street for example can be avoided by middle class teens who are able to consume alcohol in the private space of suburban homes and college dorms Poverty itself is criminalized through criminalization for example of welfare rule violations which recipients of benefits may be forced into committing in order to supplement the inadequacy of benefits32 Note that this is distinct from the person whose destitution leads him to steal a loaf of bread an example thoroughly analysed in moral philosophy33 In the case of the welfare recipient abusing benefit rules the fraud is necessitated by the inadequate provision of the benefits themselves so that it is impossible to live a minimally decent life without occasionally violating benefit rules it is impossible in other words to be both poor and not criminal34 In this situation it is the social injustice of the state and not merely the circumstance of social injustice which are inadequately addressed by the state that defines and induces the subsequent criminal behaviour This demonstrates one connection between criminal justice and social justice that would be a productive focus of normative work If the CJS criminal justice system participates in class and racebased segregation and stigmatization then its operations invite ethical scrutiny and moreover normative consideration ought to include a focus on how people end up at the front door of justice and not simply on ensuring that once they have entered the system they will be treated fairly or leniently within it Without attention to this aspect of the states criminalization of people normative consideration of poverty social justice and crime invariably lead to paternalistic discussions about minimising the accountability of poor people This leads us back to a final concern about how the problem of social justice and criminal justice are related in this book which is conveyed in the connection made between social deprivation and its consequences for reduced moral capacity In raising this point I want to acknowledge that taken out of the context of a substantial work in which the authors commitment to a socially just world is not under review the offensive quality in passages like the above may appear to be over emphasized Nonetheless I do not think we can pass over without comment the framing of extreme indigence as akin to mental retardation or the state of being a child the severely socially deprived seem most vulnerableas they are less likely for complicated reasons to be guided and supervised in ways that enable them to avoid stunted or warped moral personalities 141 This raises for me not a question about Lippkes motives but one about the ability to conduct debates about social justice through the categories and vernacular of legal and normative theory That is aside from just getting the facts wrong about poverty and crime there is an ontological obstacle as well This concern is inspired by Barbara Hudsons attempt to intervene in the analytical philosophical debate about social justice in which she suggests the issue may be in the nature of legal categories themselves in which defences grounded in claims about reduced capacity are unable to encompass other nonpaternalistic ways of conceptualising responsibility35 She claims a basic difference between the world views of social science and law that are largely justified through the concepts of moral philosophy in which sociological understandings of poverty cannot be accommodated within laws definitions of duress excuse justification and so on36 Another way of putting it is that the law can only see social injustice through a set of categories organised around the behaviour of the individual actor Deprivation and inequality thus become reduced to and are only actionable as personal characteristics of the offender rather than as properties of a society or consequences of state action The question is whether the individual focus of the criminal law can be reconciled with the social dynamics of inequality and deprivation to produce a criminal justice system which survives ethical scrutiny not just of its component processes but of its outcomes as well37 Hudsons attempt to solve this clash requires first of all explicit recognition that the criminal justice system is primarily concerned with regulating the transgressions of the poor noting that not only sociologists have pointed this out quoting Richard Posner the criminal law is designed primarily for the nonaffluent the affluent are kept in line for the most part by tort law38 Once we have done this communitybased sentences rather than imprisonment should be designated as the normal or default punishment This would move sentencing away from a notion of proportionality that is prisoncentric in its artificial and simplistic designation of penal severity quantitatively as temporal increments and nothing more Community sentences in contrast involve more qualitative decisions about appropriate conditions and level of supervision they also lend themselves better to restorative aims for justice systems Carlin 1 Carlin Amanda The Courtroom as White Space Racial Performance as Noncredibility UCLA Law Review vol 63 no 450 2016 wwwuclalawrevieworgwpcontentuploads201602CarlinfinalarticlenobleedpdfAs the previous Part has demonstrated people of color have historically been excluded from the courtroom Relying on critical race theory CRT Part II analyzes the effect this history has had on the development of the courtroom as a white space A foundational tenet of CRT is the recognition that the law is constitutive of race As its point of departure CRT engages in a sociohistorical critique of the law based on the particular understanding that the law has historically taken an active role in defining whiteness Through Reconstructionera civil rights cases and naturalization law courts have reinscribed the narratives and values of whiteness to determine its exclusionary contours It is not only through doctrine however that the law is cloaked in whiteness Even more fundamentally the courtroom itself is a distinctly white space As a white space the courtroom is ignorant of its own whiteness positioning its codes of conduct as exercises in neutrality and reason while implicitly signifying the inappropriateness of raced and gendered deviationswhat legal scholar Barbara Flagg calls the transparency phenomenon This Part seeks to first define white space and then deconstruct it by illuminating its transparency and situating people of color therein Through the formal exclusion of people of color from testifying in court and serving on juries the courtroom was populated exclusively by whites who served as the judges juries witnesses and advocates inside courthouse walls Thus every opinion coloring the development of the judicial system was a white one The judicial determinations as well as the legal narrative voice developed within this white spaceShe continuesThe exclusion of people of color became a nonracial exclusion and the whiteness of the jury box became a nonracial given The concurrent privileging and obscuring of whiteness in these explicitly white decisions evidences the courtroom as white space By presenting the formal exclusion of people of color from the courtroom as natural and nonracial the courtroom could continue to segregate through subtler more embedded means Having deemed white commissioners decisions as nonracial the whiteness of the courtroom was reinforced and in turn influenced courtroom expectations In other words with only white people present inside the courtroom the norms of the court developed as distinctly white And as a result the courtroom privileged whiteness while simultaneously treating whiteness as nonracial According to anthropologists Helán Page and R Brooke Thomas Either in its material or symbolic dimensions white public space is comprised of all the places where racism is reproduced by the professional class That space may entail particular or generalized locations sites patterns configurations tactics or devices that routinely discursively and sometimes coercively privilege EuroAmericans over nonwhites The routinized discursive and coercive tactics inside the courtroom are tools that create and buttress the courtroom as white space As Page and Thomas add White privilege is institutionally and interpersonally constructed in white public space when social closure takes place in the interest of the dominant group White privilege operates through laws barring participation of nonwhites in legal proceedings and interpersonal decision making by whites White privilege becomes the standard nonwhite participation which does not conform to the white standard is consequently foreclosed as outside the legal norm Whats more this reconstituting is selfperpetuating as the legal behaviors and traditionsthat is white codes of conduct legal precedent steeped in white norms as well as past decisions privileging whitespersist through the continued dominance of whites inside the courtroom Alexander 12 Alexander Michelle Opinion  Go to Trial Crash the Justice System The New York Times The New York Times 10 Mar 2012 wwwnytimescom20120311opinionsundaygototrialcrashthejusticesystemhtmlAfter years as a civil rights lawyer I rarely find myself speechless But some questions a woman I know posed during a phone conversation one recent evening gave me pause What would happen if we organized thousands even hundreds of thousands of people charged with crimes to refuse to play the game to refuse to plea out What if they all insisted on their Sixth Amendment right to trial Couldnt we bring the whole system to a halt just like that The woman was Susan Burtons who knows a lot about being processed through the criminal justice system Her odyssey began when a Los Angeles police cruiser ran over and killed her 5yearold son Consumed with grief and without access to therapy or antidepressant medications Susan became addicted to crack cocaine She lived in an impoverished black community under siege in the war on drugs and it was but a matter of time before she was arrested and offered the first of many plea deals that left her behind bars for a series of drugrelated offenses Every time she was released she found herself trapped in an undercaste subject to legal discrimination in employment and housing Fifteen years after her first arrest Susan was finally admitted to a private drug treatment facility and given a job After she was clean she dedicated her life to making sure no other woman would suffer what she had been through Susan now runs five safe homes for formerly incarcerated women in Los Angeles Her organization A New Way of Life supplies a lifeline for women released from prison But it does much more it is also helping to start a movement With groups like All of Us or None it is organizing formerly incarcerated people and encouraging them to demand restoration of their basic civil and human rights I was stunned by Susans question about plea bargains because she  of all people  knows the risks involved in forcing prosecutors to make cases against people who have been charged with crimes Could she be serious about organizing people on a large scale to refuse to pleabargain when charged with a crime Yes Im serious she flatly replied I launched predictably into a lecture about what prosecutors would do to people if they actually tried to stand up for their rights The Bill of Rights guarantees the accused basic safeguards including the right to be informed of charges against them to an impartial fair and speedy jury trial to crossexamine witnesses and to the assistance of counsel But in this era of mass incarceration  when our nations prison population has quintupled in a few decades partly as a result of the war on drugs and the get tough movement  these rights are for the overwhelming majority of people hauled into courtrooms across America theoretical More than 90 percent of criminal cases are never tried before a jury Most people charged with crimes forfeit their constitutional rights and plead guilty The truth is that government officials have deliberately engineered the system to assure that the jury trial system established by the Constitution is seldom used said Timothy Lynch director of the criminal justice project at the libertarian Cato Institute In other words the system is rigged In the race to incarcerate politicians champion stiff sentences for nearly all crimes including harsh mandatory minimum sentences and threestrike laws the result is a dramatic power shift from judges to prosecutors The Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that threatening someone with life imprisonment for a minor crime in an effort to induce him to forfeit a jury trial did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to trial Thirteen years later in Harmelin v Michigan the court ruled that life imprisonment for a firsttime drug offense did not violate the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishment No wonder then that most people waive their rights Take the case of Erma Faye Stewart a single AfricanAmerican mother of two who was arrested at age 30 in a drug sweep in Hearne Tex in 2000 In jail with no one to care for her two young children she began to panic Though she maintained her innocence her courtappointed lawyer told her to plead guilty since the prosecutor offered probation Ms Stewart spent a month in jail and then relented to a plea She was sentenced to 10 years probation and ordered to pay a 1000 fine Then her real punishment began upon her release Ms Stewart was saddled with a felony record she was destitute barred from food stamps and evicted from public housing Once they were homeless Ms Stewarts children were taken away and placed in foster care In the end she lost everything even though she took the deal On the phone Susan said she knew exactly what was involved in asking people who have been charged with crimes to reject plea bargains and press for trial Believe me I know Im asking what we can do Can we crash the system just by exercising our rights The answer is yes The system of mass incarceration depends almost entirely on the cooperation of those it seeks to controls If everyone charged with crimes suddenly exercised their his constitutional rights there would not be enough judges lawyers or prison cells to deal with the ensuing tsunami of litigation Not everyone would have to join for the revolt to have an impact as the legal scholar Angela J Davis noted If the number of people exercising their trial rights suddenly doubled or tripled in some jurisdictions it would create chaos Such chaos would force mass incarceration to the top of the agenda for politicians and policy makers leaving them only two viable options sharply scale back the number of criminal cases filed for drug possession for example or amend the Constitution or eviscerate it by judicial emergency fiat Either action would create a crisis and the system would crash  it could no longer function as it had before Mass protest would force a public conversation that to date we have been content to avoid In telling Susan that she was right I found myself uneasy As a mother myself I dont think theres anything I wouldnt plead guilty to if a prosecutor told me that accepting a plea was the only way to get home to my children I said I truly cant imagine risking life imprisonment so how can I urge others to take that risk  even if it would send shock waves through a fundamentally immoral and unjust system Susan silent for a while replied Im not saying we should do it Im saying we ought to know that its an option People should understand that simply exercising their rights would shake the foundations of our justice system which works only so long as we accept its terms As you know another brutal system of racial and social control once prevailed in this country and it never would have ended if some people werent willing to risk their lives It would be nice if reasoned argument would do but as weve seen thats just not the case So maybe just maybe if we truly want to end this system some of us we will have to risk our lives Saldanha 07 Arun Saldanha professor of geography at the University of Minnesota Psychedelic White Goa Trance and the Viscosity of Race University of Minnesota Press Minneapolis MN pg 198In no real sense did the hippies become Indians or poor blacks or prostitutes or tramps or only in a guilty disingenuous sense but they found their own significance in what they took these groups to be a significance to be understood against the dominant society and with respect to their own special awareness says the ethnographer Paul Willis 11 Seeing blacks Mexicans and Indians as more authentic because relatively untouched by mainstream white modernity the counterculture transformed white modernity by appropriating some of that authenticity But it is that very appropriation that betrays white privilege and that spawns new tropes of subcultural and potentially racist snobbism A creative movement turning in on itself becoming paranoid and reactionary is what Guattari called microfascism Psychedelics clearly turned microfascistic in Anjuna accompanied as it was by arrogance segregation noise pollution corruption exploitation and psychosis If whiteness is defined by its lines of flight microfascism becomes as interesting to the study of whiteness as Nazism Psychedelics travel music drugs is whiteness accelerating whiteness stuttering either a deeper entrenchment into economic and cultural exploitation or a shedding of privilege at least here and now On the whole the Goa freaks of Anjuna do not follow the lines of flight of whiteness to critique their own position as whites In this sense they were hardly freaking the racial assemblage Recall the proposition of Rachel Adams and Leslie Fiedler of appropriating freak as a critical category Freaks cannot be neatly aligned with any particular identity or ideological position Rather freak is typically used to connote the absence of any known category of identityI am drawn to freak because like queer it is a concept that refuses the logic of identity politics and the irreconcilable problems of inclusion and exclusion that necessarily accompany identitarian categories 12 A true freaking of whiteness would grasp its lines of flight not for fascism but for a future where palerskinned bodies have no privileged access to economic and cultural capital and to happiness Freaking whiteness is problembased coalitionled and selfcritical it would try to understand what biophysical and technological forces subtend it computers HIV floods radiation Humanism and cosmopolitanism are severely limited if the struggle against racism is defined only in human terms So race should not be abandoned or abolished but proliferated Races energies are then directed at multiplying racial differences so as to render them joyfully cacophonic What is needed is an affirmation of races virtuality When racial formations crumble and mingle like this the dominance of whiteness in the global racial assemblage is undermined as the faciality machine finds it increasingly difficult to take hold of bodies It is not that everyone becomes completely Brownian or brown completely similar or completely unique It is just that white supremacism slowly becomes obsolete as other racial formations start harboring the same creativity as whites do now linking all sorts of phenotypes with all sorts of wealth and all sorts of ways of life sedentary touristic ascetic When no racial formation is the standard race acquires a very different meaning The racetribe exists only at the level of an oppressed race and in the name of the oppression it suffers there is no race but inferior minoritarian there is no dominant race a race is defined not by its purity but rather by the impurity conferred upon it by a system of domination Bastard and mixedblood are the true names of race 13 When no racial formation is clearly hegemonic perhaps there will be no need anymore for the term race Although there will always be phenotypical variation and relations of power perhaps sometime in the future they wont be correlated at all Unlikely but possible Until then however there seems little point in trying to stop talking about race as antiracists such as Paul Gilroy suggest we do 14 Race is creative and we can heed its creativities against itself Challenging the global faciality machine encompasses the transformation not just of prejudice tabloid journalism and Unesco but of the pharmaceutical industry farm subsidies seismology the arms trade income tax policy and the International Monetary Fund In contrast to what many antiracists and advocates of political correctness prescribe the sites where the most urgent battles are to be fought are not culture and language but trade and health Freaking whiteness is no easy task A good start for social scientists however is to acknowledge the persistent materiality of race It is important that the real barriers to mobility and imagination that exist in different places be taken into account Cosmopolitanism has to be invented not imposed Taking responsibility and activism will only follow from both understanding and feeling the intensive differences that exist between many different kinds of bodies between a Jew and a black soldier between a woman in the Sahel and a woman on Wall Street between a Peruvian peasant and a Chinese journalist Carlin 2 Carlin Amanda The Courtroom as White Space Racial Performance as Noncredibility UCLA Law

the rules of the courtroom As one repeatedly cited blogger noted Rachel was raw emotional aggressive and hostile and she was unapologetically herself126 While the defense and the jury used her nonconformance as fodder to discredit her many of Jeantels supporters saw her nonconformance as an act of defiance or at least selfpreservation127 By refusing to follow the strict white codes of courtroom respectability and narrativean endeavor she could never actually succeed atJeantel instead asserted and affirmed her presence in a hostile space Professor Bradley points outJeantels refusal and inability to conform to expected cultural and aural scripts of black womanhood within the confines of the courtroomthe epitome of a hyperrespectable spacedestabilizes not only racial paradigms of black southern respectability but Americanized expectations of black womensscripts of respectability128 Jeantel revealed the courtrooms transparent whiteness by refusing to play into it Her inability and refusal to present a white narrative highlighted the fact that there was no place for her in that courtroom The defenses tactics to discredit her became unsubtle attempts at exclusion129 The more she refused to conform the more blatant these tactics of exclusion became exposing the hostility and violence of the courtroom130 When she took the stand Jeantel was under siege She was criticized and discredited when she did not and could not provide thewhite legal narrative the courtroom has come to expect CONCLUSION The courtroom has created a white space through the historical and consistent exclusion of people and narratives of color Jeantel flouted these norms by performing blackness on the stand And by performing blackness she was disparaged and her testimony diminished Yet the very disparagers that rejected Jeantels testimony potentially also sealed their own fate by highlighting the inappropriateness of Jeantels race and class they inevitably called attention to their own

followed a route laid out for them by a police escort and arrived finally at a deserted police building After some chanting and shouting the crowd quietly dispersed Local newspapers indeed were able to report that in the case of San Diego the city remained relatively calm in the aftermath of the King verdict5 The failure of nonviolent resistance to register anything but the most polite disapproval I suggest is the effect of a glaring lack of imagination on the part of political organizers and an overemphasis on organization itself which often produces determined efforts to eradicate expressions of rage or anger from political protest Such expressions after all might lead to something spontaneous something that spills across the carefully drawn police lines something threatening

power that constitute and regulates the subject Resistance may orient itself towards constitutive norms and discourses that colonize the inner psychic space of the subject or may be directed against regulative conditions that define categorize and govern the subject In both instances resistance is counterconduct that takes place on or through specific geographies in the mind in public squares on streets before parliaments palaces army bases embassies inside courts parks prisons and on cyberspace Whatever the specific nature of the action  a march a sitin strike graffiti hunger strike or other visible or invisible expressions or gestures of struggle  resistance always involves spatialities of location and discourse It always takes place and involves the spatialization of discourse and action Regardless of where it takes place within the fortress of sovereignty or away from its centres of gravity resistance is a profoundly spatial undertaking whose condition of possibility significance and meaning cannot be adequately explained in isolation from the place in which it takes place As Michel Foucault pointed out It is somewhat arbitrary to try to dissociate the effective practice of freedom by people the practice of social relations and the spatial distributions in which they find themselves If they are separated they become impossible to understand5 While space makes resistance possible resistance in turn defines space as space of resistance From Beijings Tiananmen Square to Tehrans Azadi Square from Santiagos Alameda to Athenss Syntagma from Madrids Plaza del Sol to New Yorks Zuccotti Park from Kievs Independence Square to Cairos Tahrir or Istanbuls Gezi we observe the mutuallyconstitutive relations between space and acts and gestures of resistance Space prefigures acts of resistance and informs their meaning and significance To speak of geographies of resistance suggests that resistance has its own distinct spatialities However resistance cannot be fully uncoupled from domination and does not have an independent and autonomous spatiality of its own Resistance often occupies and deploys spatialities defined and made available by the very power and discourse it resists  What unites these diverse range of thinkers is what may be called the socialconstructivist paradigm that views space both as product and productive From Foucaults discursive space to Derridas spacing from Lefebvres constructivist paradigm to Sojas thirdspace from Saids imaginative geography to Jamesons cognitive mapping there is a useful conceptual paradigm filled with implications and insights for thinking about the spatiality of resistance and the courtroom It is a paradigm that treats space as a social product and meaning as a function of the spatiotemporal matrix within which it emerges meaning is no longer independent of the space in which it emerges but a function of it29 Within this interpretive paradigm meaning is conceived as socially generated something specific to time and place and immanent in the spatiotemporal matrix within which it emerges According to this perspective an artefact has no essential or intrinsic meaning of its own The secret of an artefact lies in the place in which it was produced and the machinery that produced it Rather than uncovering some hidden truths and juridical meanings the point of spatial enquiry is to ask how that artefact came to have the kind of reality it now has and what made it possible It is to strip bare the conditions of possibility of knowledge generation and meaning production as a contingent and heterogeneous process of production30 But resistance is also an irreducibly temporal formation whose consequences could not be fully understood in the immediate aftermath of specific episodes of resistance As Johan van der Walts chapter shows Nelson Mandelas and Bram Fischers renegade performances at the Rivonia Trial could not be adequately accounted for without a particular attention to time Only after reflection mirroring and speculative representation can we begin to think and make sense of these gestures  only when time gives can we understand the meanings and effects of those moments of madness Mandela and fellow defendants were renegades who were up to something but did not quite know what they were about they did not know what those defiant acts and gestures

Conversation in Ruins Race and Black Participation in Lincoln Douglas Debate Vbriefly 2013It will be uncomfortable it will be hard and it will require continued effort but the necessary step in fixing this problem like all problems is the community as a whole admitting that such a problem with many socially acceptable choices exists in the first place Like all systems of social control the reality of racism in debate is constituted by the singular choices that institutions coaches and students make on a weekly basis I have watched countless rounds where competitors attempt to win by rushing to abstractions to distance the conversation from the material reality that black debaters are forced to deal with every day One of the students I coached who has since graduated after leaving debate had an adult judge write out a ballot that concluded by hypothetically defending my student being lynched at the tournament Another debate concluded with a young man defending that we can kill animals humanely just like we did that guy Troy Davis Community norms would have competitors do intellectual gymnastics or make up rules to accuse black debaters of breaking to escape hard conversations but as someone who understands that experience the only constructive strategy is to acknowledge the reality of the oppressed engage the discussion from the perspective of authors who are black and brown and then find strategies to deal with the issues at hand It hurts to see competitive seasons come and go and have high school students and judges spew the same hateful things you expect to hear at a Klan rally A student should not when presenting an advocacy that aligns them with the oppressed have to justify why oppression is bad Debate is not just a game but a learning environment with liberatory potential Even if the form debate gives to a conversation is not the same you would use to discuss race in general conversation with Bayard Rustin or Fannie Lou Hamer that is not a reason we have to strip that conversation of its connection to a reality that black students cannot escape Delgado Richard Delgado Charles Inglis Thomson Professor of Law University of Colorado JD University

American Academy of Political and Social Science vol 651 2014 pp 159177 wwwjstororgstable24541699  ABMLIn 1971 historian Lawrence Cremin 1970 xii argued in the first volume of his trilogy American Education that education was the deliberate systematic and sustained effort to transmit or evoke knowledge attitudes values skills and sen sibilities Notably his definition of education traveled well beyond schools as the technology to achieve these goals Following Cremin educational historians have documented the myriad ways in which colonial Americans learned to read and write how slaves transmitted culture how militaries churches workplaces museums popular magazines prisons and major events have educated Americans generally and specifically with respect to their appropriate roles in the polity The cynosure of this expansive definition for Cremin at least was the classical Greek concept of paidiea For the Greeks paidiea was all the knowledge of what it meant to be a citizen as well as all the various ways in which it was transmitted to future citizens Classicist Werner Jaeger 1945 xiv explained it as the delib erate endeavor to educate each new generation of individuals so as to make them in its own image As Americans developed their own historically exceptional democracy Cremin 1970 concluded they too developed a unique paidiea which over the course of the nineteenth century they increasingly but not exclu sively lodged in public institutionsespecially schools Like Cremin we employ the idea of paidiea when we say that the CJS criminal justice system is simply another path for nationstates to achieve the goals of reproducing citizens and civil society It is a process that does not cleanly sepa rate education from context because education is of as well as for creating con text Unlike Cremin however we are not sanguine about the nature of that path While the criminal justice system like the public schooling system educates people about their relationship to the state it does so in a society in which there is no single standard of civic identity The Greeks imagined paidiea as a universal concept among citizens in a context in which most people were not citizens but slaves In America the rise of formal education through state institutions that were ostensibly egalitarian actually served to define civic boundaries between insiders and outsiders in a space where these concepts were contestedwith race gender and to a lesser degree social class being the primary markers of a civic hierarchy Even if we accept that the Greeks did have a coherent paidiea where educational processes aligned to the ideal of a common civic identity we cannot accept that such coherence has ever existed in the United States of America eg Moss 2009 Anderson 1988 Justice 2009 When we turn from schools to criminal justice the collapse of local democratic control over the crimi nal justice system in the late twentieth century also problematizes a comparison between Athenian and American justice2 Our particular concern is with the core of the educational experience the cur riculum The word curriculum comes from Latin meaning race course In the early twentieth century educational theorists used the word curriculum to describe a course of structured experiences that students would pass through on their way toward the transformative ends of their formal education Insofar as public schools existed to turn children into citizens the curriculum of schools has been at the center of political struggles usually more symbolic than substantive over what good citizenship means While these struggles have reflected deep divides and varied agendas nearly all protagonists in the curriculum wars in the last century have shared the positive belief that the overt curriculum of schools will improve the individual and thus directly or indirectly benefit the state by making good citizens Schiro 2008 Curriculum in its most Utopian conception sought to help students answer the question what is most worth knowing as a vehicle for becoming someone who is most worth being Bobbit 1918 Utopianists aside any curriculum for the purpose of civic education presup poses that life outside of the race course is insufficient to achieve the curriculums goals Schools add value All modern states provide schooling at public expense for this reason James Madison Thomas Jefferson and other members of the Revolutionary political intelligencia argued that schooling would be necessary not only to make people more virtuous and smarter but also to make them more homogeneous eg Rush 1786 In our own time Putnam 2001 has used human capital theory to explain in detail what the Founding Fathers believed the modern nationstate depends on a shared sense of identity that is at heart a fiction States need citizens systems of mass education produce them Boli Ramirez and Meyer 1985 Not surprisingly culture wars over the overt content of a public school education have been an endemic feature of public school sys tems since their emergence in the midnineteenth century reflecting competing visions of what good citizenship entails The hidden curriculum may be found in adultstudent and studentstudent interactions in the enforcement of school discipline policies and behavior codes in the deeply buried assumptions and narratives of history textbooks in a school s choice of mascot in who gets to sit where in the cafeteria or the musical selections at the prom Community context is a major factor In one classic study Anyon 1980 found that despite having the same overt curriculum fifthgrade students in five different New Jersey elementary schools were trained differ ently in how to relate to it In two workingclass neighborhood schools the teachers and students emphasized mechanical and procedural learning with little decisionmaking or choice In the middleclass schools teachers and stu dents emphasized getting the right answer and getting a good grade while in the professional and executiveelite neighborhood schools teachers and students engaged in creative thinking independent learning and sharpening intellectual skills In another vein numerous studies have shown that officially neutral zero tolerance policies for school violence reduction are disproportionately enforced on males ethnic minorities and the poor eg Casella 2003 Verdugo 2002 Still other scholars have noted strong variance in compatibility between school culture including the overt social studies curriculum and home culture and historical experience especially for students of color eg Epstein 1998 Barton and Levstik 1998 Alongside what schools say they teach is another curriculum that includes lessons about who matters or does not and whether the overt school curriculum and the republic for which it stands is legitimate or arbitrary liberating or oppressive The hidden curriculum has no overt publicly debated logic Instead it is usu ally the result of school culture which itself reflects the institutional demands highlighted by Jackson 1968 or the unstated prejudices and assumptions of the community faculty and administration and broader society Importantly in set tings where there is strong congruence between the schools overt curriculum and its constituent students teachers and community the hidden and overt cur riculum can work together in mutually reinforcing waysteaching students the necessary habits of democratic living such as toleration deliberation and fair ness In other settings however where students and their families do not con form to mainstream civic identity or where the school faculty and administration do not belong to the community they serve the hidden curriculum can serve to reinforce antidemocratic behaviors manufacture failure and encourage aliena tion eg Eckstein 1984 Whether a schools overt civics curriculum academic approach to learning about democracy or a comprehensive problem solving approach and here there is significant debate among scholars the hid den curriculum of schooling can offer daily counterproductive lessons in how not to be a citizen especially for those groups of children who have been historically marginalized At its worst the hidden curriculum of the public school can offer lessons in who is deserving of arbitrary or harsh punishments whose gender or color or social class is a liability whose history does not count and whose lan guage customs and values are of no consequence The school curriculum is not the only source of civic education of course Research shows that extracurricular activities potentially have a more powerful effect than curricular ones for inculcating desirable civic skills and dispositions Murphy 2004 Youniss McClellan and Yates 1997 Outside of school students learn through social context neighborhood institutions family home life peers and through mass media including television the Web and video gaming Nevertheless children still find the public school curriculum to be the primary source of education provided by the state about the state both overtly and because the school experience is itself a primary contact point For a significant and growing segment of the American population however there is a second contact point with the state that also offers lessons on what it means to be a citi zen the criminal justice system Justice and Meares 2 JUSTICE BENJAMIN and TRACEY L MEARES How the Criminal Justice System Educates Citizens The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science vol 651 2014 pp 159177 wwwjstororgstable24541699  ABMLThrough overt and hidden curricula the CJS criminal justice system educates citi zens on the proper relationship they should have with the state While the overt curriculum is framed as educative in a positive senseencouraging or changing behavior to align with the democratic goals of the statethe hidden curriculum of the CJS criminal justice system manages and promotes education that is the posi tive images photographic negative3 To make this argument we shall draw generally on the theoretical framework offered by legal socialization which explains how people learn about the law legal systems their government and their appropriate role with respect to each through actual experiences More specifically we draw on the concepts of legitimacy and procedural justice as research into these ideas documents the psychological links people tend to draw between characteristics of legal practices and of interactions that citizens have with legal authorities and their conclusions that laws systems or authori ties are fair Lind and Tyler 1988 explain that when making judgments regarding the legitimacy of state authorities people look to indicia of procedural justice in their actions These scholars tell us that people care a great deal about being able to participate in official decisions being listened to and having their views consid ered by authorities They also value the neutrality of the decisionmaking pro cess In particular people expect decisions to be based on objective information Perhaps the most important facet of socially grounded procedural justice is qual ity of treatment People desire to be treated politely and with dignity These characteristics of procedural justice supports peoples beliefs about legitimacy of important state functions including the CJS criminal justice system and public schools The reason people care about procedural justice is that it provides them with important informational signals that they view as relevant to their identities People tend to seek a favorable social identity within the groups to which they belong People also seek a favorable social status for their group visàvis other groups The relationship that people have or potentially have with governmental authorities provides them with critical information about their individual and groupbased status We use these criteria here to evaluate messages the CJS criminal justice system consistently conveys to certain groups through its everyday opera tion We can then determine the extent to which the everyday operation laden with hidden curriculum supports or detracts from the overt education in democ racy the system purports to project We contend that the state consistently educates by producing two distinct sets of messages that function as overt and hidden curricula The former reinforces perceptions of procedural justice for those who in reality rarely experience the hidden curriculum firsthand The latter hidden curriculum is inconsistent with procedural justice and the consequence is that the objects of this education those people who most often run its courseare discouraged from attributing legitimacy to laws legal systems and regimes That is to say those experiencing the hidden curriculum are bombarded with messages that they are not citizens belonging to the group of the whole in charge of governing but are a class of problem people to be excluded monitored and surveilled treated harshly and punished arbitrarily Those citizens whose experiences with the system are pri marily with its overt curriculum one of democracy and fairness are encouraged to accord the system high legitimacy as long as they accept or remain ignorant of the hidden curriculum for others What remains is to explain how component parts of the system convey consistent messages of inclusion and vilification  Espinoza 03 Tejeda Carlos Manuel Espinoza and Kris Gutierrez Toward a decolonizing pedagogy Social justice reconsidered Pedagogies of difference Rethinking education for social change 2003 938Critical pedagogy has put forth the notion that classroom practice integrates particular curriculum content and design instructional strategies and techniques and forms of evaluation It argues that these specify a particular version about what knowledge is of most worth what it means to know something and how we might construct a representation of our world and our place within it McLaren 1998 From this perspective the pedagogical is inherently political For us a decolonizing pedagogy encompasses both an anticolonial and decolonizing notion of pedagogy and an anticolonial and decolonizing pedagogical praxis It is an anticolonial and decolonizing theory and praxis that insists that colonial domination and its ideological frameworks operate and are reproduced in and through the curricular content and design the instructional practices the social organization of learning and the forms of evaluation that inexorably sort and label students into enduring categories of success and failure of schooling Thus an anticolonial and decolonizing pedagogical praxis explicitly works to transform these dimensions of schooling so that schools become sites for the development of a critical decolonizing consciousness and activity that work to ameliorate and ultimately end the mutually constitutive forms of violence that characterize our internal neocolonial condition For us a decolonizing pedagogy addresses both the means and the ends of schooling

race theory CRT Part II analyzes the effect this history has had on the development of the courtroom as a white space A foundational tenet of CRT is the recognition that the law is constitutive of race As its point of departure CRT engages in a sociohistorical critique of the law based on the particular understanding that the law has historically taken an active role in defining whiteness Through Reconstructionera civil rights cases and naturalization law courts have reinscribed the narratives and values of whiteness to determine its exclusionary contours It is not only through doctrine however that the law is cloaked in whiteness Even more fundamentally the courtroom itself is a distinctly white space As a white space the courtroom is ignorant of its own whiteness positioning its codes of conduct as exercises in neutrality and reason while implicitly signifying the inappropriateness of raced and gendered deviationswhat legal scholar Barbara Flagg calls the transparency phenomenon This Part seeks to first define white space and then deconstruct it by illuminating its transparency and situating people of color therein Through the formal exclusion of people of color from testifying in court and serving on juries the courtroom was populated exclusively by whites who served as the judges juries witnesses and advocates inside courthouse walls Thus every opinion coloring the development of the judicial system was a white one The judicial determinations as well as the legal narrative voice developed within this white space The exclusion of people of color became a nonracial exclusion and the whiteness of the jury box became a nonracial given The concurrent privileging and obscuring of whiteness in these explicitly white decisions evidences the courtroom as white space By presenting the formal exclusion of people of color from the courtroom as natural and nonracial the courtroom could continue to segregate through subtler more embedded means Having deemed white commissioners decisions as nonracial the whiteness of the courtroom was reinforced and in turn influenced courtroom expectations In other words with only white people present inside the courtroom the norms of the court developed as distinctly white And as a result the courtroom privileged whiteness while simultaneously treating whiteness as nonracial According to anthropologists Helán Page and R Brooke Thomas Either in its material or symbolic dimensions white public space is comprised of all the places where racism is reproduced by the professional class That space may entail particular or generalized locations sites patterns configurations tactics or devices that routinely discursively and sometimes coercively privilege EuroAmericans over nonwhites The routinized discursive and coercive tactics inside the courtroom are tools that create and buttress the courtroom as white space As Page and Thomas add White privilege is institutionally and interpersonally constructed in white public space when social closure takes place in the interest of the dominant group White privilege operates through laws barring participation of nonwhites in legal proceedings and interpersonal decision making by whites White privilege becomes the standard nonwhite participation which does not conform to the white standard is consequently foreclosed as outside the legal norm Whats more this reconstituting is selfperpetuating as the legal behaviors and traditionsthat is white codes of conduct legal precedent steeped in white norms as well as past decisions privileging whitespersist through the continued dominance of whites inside the courtroom Alexander 12 Alexander Michelle Opinion  Go to Trial Crash the Justice System The New York Times The New York Times 10 Mar 2012 wwwnytimescom20120311opinionsundaygototrialcrashthejusticesystemhtml  ABMLAfter years as a civil rights lawyer I rarely find myself speechless But some questions a woman I know posed during a phone conversation one recent evening gave me pause What would happen if we organized thousands even hundreds of thousands of people charged with crimes to refuse to play the game to refuse to plea out What if they all insisted on their Sixth Amendment right to trial Couldnt we bring the whole system to a halt just like that The woman was Susan Burtons who knows a lot about being processed through the criminal justice system Her odyssey began when a Los Angeles police cruiser ran over and killed her 5yearold son Consumed with grief and without access to therapy or antidepressant medications Susan became addicted to crack cocaine She lived in an impoverished black community under siege in the war on drugs and it was but a matter of time before she was arrested and offered the first of many plea deals that left her behind bars for a series of drugrelated offenses Every time she was released she found herself trapped in an undercaste subject to legal discrimination in employment and housing Fifteen years after her first arrest Susan was finally admitted to a private drug treatment facility and given a job After she was clean she dedicated her life to making sure no other woman would suffer what she had been through Susan now runs five safe homes for formerly incarcerated women in Los Angeles Her organization A New Way of Life supplies a lifeline for women released from prison But it does much more it is also helping to start a movement With groups like All of Us or None it is organizing formerly incarcerated people and encouraging them to demand restoration of their basic civil and human rights I was stunned by Susans question about plea bargains because she  of all people  knows the risks involved in forcing prosecutors to make cases against people who have been charged with crimes Could she be serious about organizing people on a large scale to refuse to pleabargain when charged with a crime Yes Im serious she flatly replied I launched predictably into a lecture about what prosecutors would do to people if they actually tried to stand up for their rights The Bill of Rights guarantees the accused basic safeguards including the right to be informed of charges against them to an impartial fair and speedy jury trial to crossexamine witnesses and to the assistance of counsel But in this era of mass incarceration  when our nations prison population has quintupled in a few decades partly as a result of the war on drugs and the get tough movement  these rights are for the overwhelming majority of people hauled into courtrooms across America theoretical More than 90 percent of criminal cases are never tried before a jury Most people charged with crimes forfeit their constitutional rights and plead guilty The truth is that government officials have deliberately engineered the system to assure that the jury trial system established by the Constitution is seldom used said Timothy Lynch director of the criminal justice project at the libertarian Cato Institute In other words the system is rigged In the race to incarcerate politicians champion stiff sentences for nearly all crimes including harsh mandatory minimum sentences and threestrike laws the result is a dramatic power shift from judges to prosecutors The Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that threatening someone with life imprisonment for a minor crime in an effort to induce him to forfeit a jury trial did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to trial Thirteen years later in Harmelin v Michigan the court ruled that life imprisonment for a firsttime drug offense did not violate the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishment No wonder then that most people waive their rights Take the case of Erma Faye Stewart a single AfricanAmerican mother of two who was arrested at age 30 in a drug sweep in Hearne Tex in 2000 In jail with no one to care for her two young children she began to panic Though she maintained her innocence her courtappointed lawyer told her to plead guilty since the prosecutor offered probation Ms Stewart spent a month in jail and then relented to a plea She was sentenced to 10 years probation and ordered to pay a 1000 fine Then her real punishment began upon her release Ms Stewart was saddled with a felony record she was destitute barred from food stamps and evicted from public housing Once they were homeless Ms Stewarts children were taken away and placed in foster care In the end she lost everything even though she took the deal On the phone Susan said she knew exactly what was involved in asking people who have been charged with crimes to reject plea bargains and press for trial Believe me I know Im asking what we can do Can we crash the system just by exercising our rights The answer is yes The system of mass incarceration depends almost entirely on the cooperation of those it seeks to controls If everyone charged with crimes suddenly exercised their his constitutional rights there would not be enough judges lawyers or prison cells to deal with the ensuing tsunami of litigation Not everyone would have to join for the revolt to have an impact as the legal scholar Angela J Davis noted If the number of people exercising their trial rights suddenly doubled or tripled in some jurisdictions it would create chaos Such chaos would force mass incarceration to the top of the agenda for politicians and policy makers leaving them only two viable options sharply scale back the number of criminal cases filed for drug possession for example or amend the Constitution or eviscerate it by judicial emergency fiat Either action would create a crisis and the system would crash  it could no longer function as it had before Mass protest would force a public conversation that to date we have been content to avoid In telling Susan that she was right I found myself uneasy As a mother myself I dont think theres anything I wouldnt plead guilty to if a prosecutor told me that accepting a plea was the only way to get home to my children I said I truly cant imagine risking life imprisonment so how can I urge others to take that risk  even if it would send shock waves through a fundamentally immoral and unjust system Susan silent for a while replied Im not saying we should do it Im saying we ought to know that its an option People should understand that simply exercising their rights would shake the foundations of our justice system which works only so long as we accept its terms As you know another brutal system of racial and social control once prevailed in this country and it never would have ended if some people werent willing to risk their lives It would be nice if reasoned argument would do but as weve seen thats just not the case So maybe just maybe if we truly want to end this system some of us we will have to risk our lives Carlin 2 Carlin Amanda The Courtroom as White Space Racial Performance as Noncredibility UCLA Law Review vol 63 no

courtroom As one repeatedly cited blogger noted Rachel was raw emotional aggressive and hostile and she was unapologetically herself126 While the defense and the jury used her nonconformance as fodder to discredit her many of Jeantels supporters saw her nonconformance as an act of defiance or at least selfpreservation127 By refusing to follow the strict white codes of courtroom respectability and narrativean endeavor she could never actually succeed atJeantel instead asserted and affirmed her presence in a hostile space Professor Bradley points outJeantels refusal and inability to conform to expected cultural and aural scripts of black womanhood within the confines of the courtroomthe epitome of a hyperrespectable spacedestabilizes not only racial paradigms of black southern respectability but Americanized expectations of black womens scripts of respectability128 Jeantel revealed the courtrooms transparent whiteness by refusing to play into it Her inability and refusal to present a white narrative highlighted the fact that there was no place for her in that courtroom The defenses tactics to discredit her became unsubtle attempts at exclusion129 The more she refused to conform the more blatant these tactics of exclusion became exposing the hostility and violence of the courtroom130 When she took the stand Jeantel was under siege She was criticized and discredited

that rejected Jeantels testimony potentially also sealed their own fate by highlighting the inappropriateness of Jeantels race and class they inevitably called attention to their own Through its

Haiven Canada Research chair in culture media and social justice at Lakehead University Commons as Actuality Ethos and Horizon Educational Commons in Theory and Practice Global Pedagogy and Politics ch 2The horizon of the commons might be said to be three things First it is the forums and venues physical and textual in which commonsoriented efforts can meet debate strategize agree to disagree make intercollective decisions trade or barter and party or plot It is the infrastructure of collaboration the syntax of struggles or the connective tissue that binds together a variety of initiatives movements people and tendencies It might take the form of a social center or an online discussion space or a conference or an international meeting In a way crypto and alternative currencies can also play this role In this sense the horizon of the commons overlaps with many actualities of the commons and it is in or through these forms of venues that the ethos of the commons is cultivated grows and spreads Second the horizon of the commons is a shared capacity to create a narrative about the past the present and the future It is our ability to tell stories about our own powers Sometimes these stories are local and sometimes they are global sometimes they are personal and sometimes they are theoretical Sometimes they delineate a process that has occurred over three weeks sometimes one that has occurred over 300 or 3000 years Each commons will be animated by many such stories and theories sometimes in confluence sometimes in conflict sometimes resonating with one another and sometimes in contradiction Between commons the sharing of such narratives and theories is a key task For instance my housing cooperative has a story about how over 30 years ago our predecessors started the coop the values they held and processes they used and these in turn affect how we conduct our business in the present and plan our future Meanwhile we work within a local milieu where a number of commonsoriented initiatives share a historical and theoretical narrative  of which we see our present efforts as a part But we also live on stolen Indigenous land in Canada which overlays another narrative We are continually discovering ways to weave these narratives together to arrive at a greater capacity for solidarity and a more potent place of collective power Finally the horizon of the commons demands an imagination vision however hazy of a future society one forged largely out of the power of negation The world we want to build must be imagined through a combination of on the one hand an extrapolation of the imperfect ethos and actuality of the commons we are building here and now and on the other a liberating and incomplete conjecture about what life might be like in the absence of exploitation domination racism genderbased oppression and so on The horizon of the common in this sense is not so much our capacity to perfectly map a future society but our ability to hold the future open More accurately it is our ability to travel through collective acts of the imagination into the future and bring back the resources to enable us to struggle in the present Jameson 2005 In the first instance this requires a utopian imagination we must be able to perform the exercise of envisioning the light of our utopian dreams not only in order to bask in a nice daydream but to be able to illuminate the contours of power and possibility in our present society This utopian projection is not pure fantasy it is the sort of world we know we could create that we ought to be allowed to create were it not for the exploitation of and the limits placed on our cooperation today Suvin 1997 We exercise this utopian imagination not to envision an endpoint of our struggle but as a way to bring into greater clarity the structures and patterns of our present day society and organizations We envision it so we can more accurately ask ourselves what prevents that utopia from becoming a reality What would it take to achieve it What stands in our way What must we do to calibrate our organizations and movements toward this end Equally how do todays structures and systems of domination oppression and exploitation shape our thinking behavior and struggles in the present What would community look like and feel like in their absence And how can we bring those lessons back from that imagined tomorrow to catalyze and improve our capacity for solidarity and care here and now Shome 96 Shome R 1996 Postcolonial Interventions in the Rhetorical Canon An Other View Communication Theory 6 4059 doi101111j146828851996tb00119x  ABML Even the recent postmodern incursions in the field seem to be somewhat problematic in this regard Scholars McGee 1975 1990 McKerrow 1989 operating from such a perspective have problematized the modernist subject on which the rhetorical tradition is largely based however they have not extended this problematizing to also identify this modernist subject as well as the modernist canon as being the subject of colonialism For as Bhabha 1990 reminds us the advent of modernism in the West was also the moment of colonialism6 The solution however is not merely to do more rhetorical studies on nonwhite people eg Campbells 1986 study on African American women speakers for that only becomes a matter of extending instead of displacing or challenging the canon by adding others Rather the solution is to critically examine and challenge the very value system on which the rhetorical canon and our scholarship is based For instance rhetoric as a discipline has been traditionally built on public address But historically public address has been a realm where imperial voices were primarily heard and imperial policies were articulated The colonized did not always have access to a public realm or if they did their speeches 49 Communication Theory were not always recorded in mainstream documents since the means of production rested with the imperial subject All this perhaps means that we have built a lot of our understanding of rhetoric and the canon of rhetoric by focusing on and often celebrating imperial voices This calls for a reexamination of our paradigms The move here is parallel to that made by feminists in their challenges of the masculinist biases of the discipline If rhetorical scholars are to reexamine the discipline in relation to issues such as imperialism neocolonialism and race then they need to perhaps do what Spivak see explanation suggests unlearn a lot of the rhetorical tradition and evaluate critically what kinds of knowledge have been and continue to be privileged legitimated and displaced in our texts and theories and what configuration of sociopolitical and racial interests this privileging displacing and legitimizing has served and continues to serve Conquergood 1991 p 193 For one thing this means engaging in some serious soul searching to uncover why scholarship in our discipline has been and continues to be so white Rakow 1989 p 2l2 It is through such postcolonial selfreflexivity of our discipline as well as our individual scholarship that we will be able to continue the task of pushing the traditional paradigms of rhetoric further in order to create spaces for racially and culturally marginalized voices and perspectives on rhetoric to emerge  voices and perspectives that would comprise sensitive postcolonial responses to the neocolonial and racist circumstances of our present time They continueThe implications of all this for our discipline is simple We simply need to engage in postcolonial analyses of texts We need to develop critical perspectives that now seek to examine and expose to what extent neocolonial forces whether they be representations of others or representations of self underwrite cultural political and academic discursive practices for as I have already suggested if texts are sites of power that are reproduced by their social conditions then neocolonial and racial forces are to some extent always already written into our texts It is only when we embrace postcolonialism as a significant critical perspective that rhetorical studies will be able to adequately engage in the present historical and social conditions A promising collusion between rhetoric and postcolonialism is also possible given that neocolonialism operates more discursively in contrast to colonialism which was more territorial and that neocolonialism operates subtly On the point of subtlety Spivak 1991 states that neocolonialism is like radiationyou feel it less like you dont feel it p 221 Both of these aspects of neocolonialism its discursivity and its subtlety suggest that rhetorics constitute neocolonial discourses in their attempts to obscure power and their interpellating capacity Given this it seems to me that rhetorical scholars could make significant contributions to the present historical moment if they took upon themselves the task of revealing and examining the various subtle rhetorical strategies through which neocolonialism establishes its hegemony As I already mentioned earlier one such strategy is the strategy of generalization whereby others are generically constructed which makes the task of affirmation of the white Western self that much easier We need similar and more detailed insights into the various other rhetorical tropes through which discursive imperialism operates While scholars Spurr 1993 Suleri 1992 in other fields such as literature have done some work in this 51 Communication Theory area I believe that this is a critical terrain that rhetorical scholars given their orientation are best suited to engage in as well as contribute to Third the postcolonial argument about diasporic cultural identities has important implications for the way identity has traditionally been conceptualized in rhetorical studies Our mainstream rhetorical theories have generally presumed the reality of the speaker and listener as transcendental subjects engaged in a mutual process of coming together Grossberg 1979 p 249 Although this position has been problematized by scholars in various ways Biesecker 1989 Grossberg 1979 McKerrow 1989 1991 I believe that the postcolonial notion of diaspora and hybridity still has much to offer in this dialogue As I have already discussed the postcolonial notion of diasporic identity suggests that with increased globalization of the world whereby people technoiogy ideas cultures and ethnic groups constantly cross borders although not often physically everyone is at cultural intersections With the softening of national boundaries and the growth of a global economy we are all in some way cultural hybrids although some of us more than others influenced by various transglobal movements of media of ideas of peoples of cultures In fact as Tololyan 1991 points out diasporas are the exemplary communities of the transnational moment p 5 italics added Given this it is no longer possible to conceive of cultures and cultural identities homogeneously for each of us in some way occupies borderland territories This is slightly different from or rather an extension of the position articulated by postmodernism In postmodernism what is in question is the individual subject in postcolonialism what is in question among other things is a homogeneous conception of culture While this position overlaps with postmodernism much of postmodern theory itself albeit implicitly tends to view cultures homogeneously since it works from a homogeneous notion of the Western world as having reached the last stage of capitalism which tends to efface cultural differences between countries The postcolonial notion of diasporic cultural identity calls for rhetorical theories that are able to address the rhetorical situations and experiences of disjunctured diasporic cultural identities We now need insights into how rhetoric functions in hybrid borderlands and cultural spaces as well as how rhetoric aids in the creation of diasporic disjunctured identities For instance a pertinent question here would be how do cultural diasporas use rhetoric to negotiate through their different culturally disjunctured or pastiched states to enable some kind of shared meaning with people in their daily existence In this connection the concept of shared meaning and understanding which has traditionally been regarded as one of the goals of rhetoric also perhaps needs to be reexamined How much meaning is shared when fractured and pastiched cultural states engage in rhetorical interactions Furthermore in dealing with issues of cultural diasporas we also need to rethink many of our Postcolonial Interventions in the Rhetorical Canon tools and methods of rhetorical criticism most of which are laden with universalist implications and examine to what extent if any they allow us to deal with and understand identity formation in a postcolonial world Fourth the postcolonial notion of discursive imperialism and its attendant rhetoric of generalization that tends to appropriate and efface differences between cultural groups has important implications for feminist scholarship in rhetorical studies Much of feminist scholarship in rhetorical studies has been carried out from a relatively liberal and generalized perspective As feminist rhetorical scholars have begun arguing for the need to include and recognize womens rhetorical and communicative perspectives they have not adequately addressed the important point although it sometimes gets mentioned in passing usually at conferences and then forgotten that a white womans rhetorical and communicative perspectives practices and experiences are not the same as nonwhite womens and cannot be universalized therein Much of feminist rhetorical scholarship by ignoring issues of race implicitly tends toward a discursive colonization whereby the discourses more often than not express and speak to the perspectives and voices of white women Adrienne Rich has called such a phenomenon white solipsism a tendency to think    and speak as if whiteness described the world cited in Spelman 1988 p 116 3/13/18Tournament Practice Round  Round Semis  Opponent   Judge FRAMINGThe standard is maximizing pleasure1 Only consequentialism explains moral substitutabilitySinnottArmstrong 92 Walter SinnottArmstrong 92 Dartmouth College Philosophical Perspectives 6 Ethics AN ARGUMENT FOR CONSEQUENTIALISMSince general substitutability works for other kinds of reasons for action we would need a strong argument to deny that it holds also for moral reasons If moral reasons obeyed different principles it would be hard to understand why moral reasons are also called reasons and how moral reasons interact with other reasons when they apply to the same action Nonetheless this extension has been denied so we have to look at moral reasons carefully I have a moral reason to feed my child tonight both because I promised my wife to do so and also because of my special relation to my child along with the fact that she will go hungry if I dont feed her I cant feed my child tonight without going home soon and going home soon will enable me to feed her tonight Therefore there is a moral reason for me to go home soon It need not be imprudent or ugly or sacrilegious or illegal for me not to feed her but the requirements of morality give me a moral reason to feed her This argument assumes a special case of substitutability MS If there is a moral reason for A to do X and if A cannot do X without doing Y and if doing Y will enable A to do X then there is a moral reason for A to do Y I will call this the principle of moral substitutability or just moral substitutabilityHe continuesOf course there are many other versions of deontology I cannot discuss them all Nonetheless these examples suggest that it is the very nature of deontological reasons that makes deontological theories unable to explain moral substitutability This comes out clearly if we start from the other side and ask which properties create the moral reasons that are derived by moral substitutability What gives me a moral reason to start the mower is the consequences of starting the mower Specifically it has the consequence that I can am able to mow the grass This reason cannot derive from the same property as my moral reason to mow the lawn unless what gives me a moral reason to mow the lawn is its consequences Thus any nonconsequentialist moral theory will have to posit two distinct kinds of moral reasons one for starting the mower and another for mowing the grass Once these kinds of reasons are separated we need to understand the connection between them But this connection cannot be explained by the substantive principles of the theory That is why all deontological theories must lack the explanatory coherence which is a general test of adequacy for all theories I conclude that no deontological theory can adequately explain moral substitutability He continuesAll other moral reasons are nonconsequential Thus a moral reason to do an act is nonconsequential if and only if the reason depends even partly on some property that the act has independently of its consequences For example an act can be a lie regardless of what happens as a result of the lie since some lies are not believed and some moral theories claim that that property of being a lie provides a moral reason not to tell a lie regardless of the consequences of this lie Similarly the fact that an act fulfills a promise is often seen as a moral reason to do the act even though the act has that property of fulfilling a promise independently of its consequences All such moral reasons are nonconsequential In order to avoid so many negations I will also call them deontological This distinction would not make sense if we did not restrict the notion of consequences If I promise to mow the lawn then one consequence of my mowing might seem to be that my promise is fulfilled One way to avoid this problem is to specify that the consequences of an act must be distinct from the act itself My act of fulfilling my promise and my act of mowing are not distinct because they are done by the same bodily movements10 Thus my fulfilling my promise is not a consequence of my mowing A consequence of an act need not be later in time than the act since causation can be simultaneous but the consequence must at least be different from the act Even with this clarification it is still hard to classify some moral reasons as consequential or deontological11 but I will stick to examples that are clear In accordance with this distinction between kinds of moral reasons I can now distinguish different kinds of moral theories I will say that a moral theory is consequentialist if and only if it implies that all basic moral reasons are consequential A moral theory is then nonconsequentialists or deontological if it includes any basic moral reasons which are not consequential 5 Against Deontology So defined the class of deontological moral theories is very large and diverse This makes it hard to say anything in general about it Nonetheless I will argue that no deontological moral theory can explain why moral substitutability holds My argument applies to all deontological theories because it depends only on what is common to them all namely the claim that some basic moral reasons are not consequential Some deontological theories allow very many weighty moral reasons that are consequential and these theories might be able to explain why moral substitutability holds for some of their moral reasons the consequential ones But even these theories cannot explain why moral substitutability holds for all moral reasons including the nonconsequential reasons that make the theory deontological The failure of deontological moral theories to explain moral substitutability in the very cases that make them deontological is a reason to reject all deontological moral theories I cannot discuss every deontological moral theory so I will discuss only a few paradigm examples and show why they cannot explain moral substitut ability After this I will argue that similar problems are bound to arise for all other deontological theories by their very nature The simplest deontological theory is the pluralistic intuitionism of Prichard and Ross Ross writes that when someone promises to do something This we consider obligatory in its own nature just because it is a fulfillment of a promise and not because of its consequences12 Such deontologists claim in effect that if I promise to mow the grass there is a moral reason for me to mow the grass and this moral reason is constituted by the fact that mowing the grass fulfills my promise This reason exists regardless of the consequences of mowing the grass even though it might be overridden by certain bad consequences However if this is why I have a moral reason to mow the grass then even if I cannot mow the grass without starting my mower and starting the mower would enable me to mow the grass it still would not follow that I have any moral reason to start my mower since I did not promise to start my mower and starting my mower does not fulfill my promise Thus a moral theory cannot explain moral substitutability if it claims that properties like this provide moral reasons  2 Phenomenal introspection is reliable and proves utilSinhababu 13 Sinhababu Neil Associate professor of philosophy

possibility that one has true beliefs it reduces the probability that my beliefs are true Consider a parallel case I have no direct evidence that I have an appendix but I know that previous investigations have revealed appendixes in people So induction supports believing that I have an appendix Similarly I know on the basis of 1 and 2 that peoples moral beliefs are in general rife with error So even if I have no direct evidence of error in my moral beliefs induction suggests that they are rife with error as well3 invokes the reliability of the processes that produce our beliefs Assessing processes of beliefformation for reliability is an essential part of our epistemic practices If someone tells me that my belief is entirely produced by wishful thinking I cannot simply accept that and maintain the belief Knowing that wishful thinking is unreliable I must either deny that my belief is entirely caused by wishful thinking or abandon the belief But if someone tells me that my belief is entirely the result of visual perception I will maintain it assuming that it concerns sizable nearby objects or some other topic on which visual perception is reliable While it is hard to provide precise criteria for individuating processes of beliefformation as the literature on the generality problem for reliabilism attests individuating them somehow is indispensable to our epistemic practices15 Following Alvin Goldmans remark that It is clear that our ordinary thought about process types slices them broadly 346 I will treat cognitive process types like wishful thinking and visual perception as appropriately broad16 Trusting particular people and texts meanwhile are too narrow Cognitive science may eventually help us better individuate cognitive process types for the purposes of reliability assessments and discover which processes produce which beliefs Epistemic internalists might reject 3 as stated claiming that it is not widespread error that would justify giving up our beliefs but our having reason to believe that there is widespread error They might also claim that our justification for believing the outputs of some process depends not on its reliability but on what we have reason to believe about its reliability The argument will still go forward if 3 is modified to suit internalist tastes changing its antecedent to If we have reason to believe that there is widespread error about a topic andor changing its consequent to we should retain only those beliefs about it that we have reason to believe were formed through reliable processes While 3s antecedent might itself seem unnecessary on the original formulation it is required for 3 to remain plausible on the internalist modification Requiring us to have reason to believe that any of our beliefformation processes are reliable before retaining their outputs might lead to skepticism The antecedent limits the scope of the requirement to cases of widespread error averting general skeptical conclusions The argument will still attain its conclusion under these modifications Successfully defending the premises of the argument and deriving widespread error 5 and unreliability 7 gives those of us who have heard the defense and derivation reason to believe 5 and 7 This allows us to derive 8 Thus the pronoun we in 3 6 and 8He continues Even though phenomenal introspection only tells me about my own phenomenal states I can know that others pleasure is good Of course I cannot phenomenally introspect their pleasures any more than I can phenomenally introspect pleasures that I will experience next year But if I consider my experiences of lemon yellow and ask what it would be like if others had the same experiences I must think that they would be having bright experiences Similarly if in a pleasant moment I consider what it is like when others have exactly the experience I am having I must think that they are having good experiences If they have exactly the same experiences I am having their experiences will have exactly the same intrinsic properties as mine This is also how I know that if I have the same experience in the future it will have the same intrinsic properties Even though the only pleasure I can introspect is mine now I should believe that pleasures experienced by others and myself at other times are good just as I should believe that yellow experienced by others and myself at other times is bright My argument thus favors the kind of universal hedonism that supports utilitarianism not egoistic hedonism 3 The role of the ballot is

power to directly control external actors 1998b p 20 Describing debates about what our government should do as attempts to control outside actors is debilitating and disempowering Control of the US government is exactly what an active participatory citizenry is supposed to be all about After all if democracy means anything it means that citizens not only have the right they also bear the obligation to discuss and debate what the government should be doing Absent that discussion and debate much of the motivation for personal political activism is also lost Those who have coopted Mitchells argument for individual advocacy often quickly respond that nothing we do in a debate round can actually change government policy and unfortunately an entire generation of debaters has now swallowed this assertion as an article of faith The best most will muster is Of course not but you dont either The assertion that nothing we do in debate has any impact on government policy is one that carries the potential to undermine Mitchells entire project If there is nothing we can do in a debate round to change government policy then we are left with precious little in the way of prosocial options for addressing problems we face At best we can pursue some Pilotlike hand washing that can purify us as individuals through quixotic activism but offer little to society as a whole It is very important to note that Mitchell 1998b tries carefully to limit and bound his notion of reflexive fiat by maintaining that because it views fiat as a concrete course of action it is bounded by the limits of pragmatism p 20 Pursued properly the debates that Mitchell would like to see are those in which the relative efficacy of concrete political strategies for prosocial change is debated In a few noteworthy examples this approach has been employed successfully and I must say that I have thoroughly enjoyed judging and coaching those debates The students in my program have learned to stretch their understanding of their role in the political process because of the experience Therefore those who say I am opposed to Mitchells goals here should take care at such a blanket assertion  However contest debate teaches students to combine personal experience with the language of political power Powerful personal narratives unconnected to political power are regularly coopted by those who do learn the language of power One need look no further than the annual state of the Union Address where personal story after personal story is used to support the political agenda of those in power The socalled roleplaying that public policy contest debates encourage promotes active learning of the vocabulary and levers of power in America Imagining the ability to use our own arguments to influence government action is one of the great virtues of academic debate Gerald Graff 2003 analyzed the decline of argumentation in academic discourse and found a source of student antipathy to public argument in an interesting place m up against their aversion to the role of public spokesperson that formal writing presupposes Its as if such students cant imagine any rewards for being a public actor or even imagining themselves in such a role This lack of interest in the public sphere may in turn reflect a loss of confidence in the possibility that the arguments we make in public will have an effect on the world Todays students lack of faith in the power of persuasion reflects the waning of the ideal of civic participation that led educators for centuries to place rhetorical and argumentative training at the center of the school and college curriculum Graff 2003 p 57 The power to imagine public advocacy that actually makes a difference is one of the great virtues of the traditional notion of fiat that critics deride as mere simulation Simulation of success in the public realm is far more empowering to students than completely abandoning all notions of personal power in the face of governmental hegemony by teaching students that nothing they can do in a contest debate can ever make any difference in public policy Contest debating is well suited to rewarding public activism if it stops accepting as an article of faith that personal agency is somehow undermined by the socalled role playing in debate Debate is roleplaying whether we imagine government action or imagine individual action Imagining myself starting a socialist revolution in America is no less of a fantasy than imagining myself making a difference on Capitol Hill Furthermore both fantasies influenced my personal and political development virtually ensuring a life of active prosocial political participation Neither fantasy reduced the likelihood that I would spend my life trying to make the difference I imagined One fantasy actually does make a greater difference the one that speaks the language of political power The other fantasy disables action by making one a laughingstock to those who wield the language of power Fantasy motivates and roleplaying trains through visualization Until we can imagine it we cannot really do it Roleplaying without question teaches students to be comfortable with the language of power and that language paves the way for genuine and effective political activism Debates over the relative efficacy of political strategies for prosocial change must confront governmental power at some point There is a fallacy in arguing that movements represent a better political strategy than voting and persontoperson advocacy Sure a fullscale movement would be better than the limited voice I have as a participating citizen going from door to door in a campaign but so would fullscale government action Unfortunately the gap between my individual decision to pursue movement politics and the emergence of a fullscale movement is at least as great as the gap between my vote and democratic change They both represent utopian fiat Invocation of Mitchell to support utopian movement fiat is simply not supported by his work and too often such invocation discourages the concrete actions he argues for in favor of the personal rejectionism that under girds

plea bargaining Yet a total ban on plea bargaining is not the optimal response to the systems deficiencies  and not only because such a ban would be unsustainable in an overloaded criminal justice system A better response would be a partial ban on plea bargaining meaning a system that only prohibits plea bargains when the concession offered to the defendant in return for his guilty plea is large With plea concessions restricted in such a way defendants with relatively high chances of acquittal at trial would refuse to plea bargain That way prosecuting a weak case would usually result in a trial while a strong cases would be disposed through plea bargaining Since prosecution resources do not allow for a high trial rate prosecutors will be forced to refrain from bringing weak cases in order to direct scarce resources to stronger cases that can be settled A partial ban therefore encourages prosecutors to refrain from bringing weak cases and reduces the risk of an innocent person being chargedThey continueHow would this partial ban work It is admittedly difficult for courts to directly evaluate the strength of a case One might argue that not knowing which cases are weak courts would not be able to implement such a partial ban The purpose of this Article is to show that a partial ban can be implemented without requiring courts to directly review the strength of the cases

someone it is up to prosecutors to decide whether or not to charge the person with a crime The system depends heavily on prosecutors to decline cases that lack evidence But prosecutors often fail to screen misdemeanors precisely because they are seen as insignificant and instead charge all petty arrestees on whatever basis the police arrested them Studies in Iowa New York and North Carolina reveal that prosecutors declined only 3 or 4 percent of petty offenses In jurisdictions like these 96 percent of arrests convert automatically into criminal charges Once charged misdemeanor suspects have little choice but to plead guilty As the NACDL study revealed many of these suspects will not get lawyers and courts rush cases through in order to clear crowded dockets Jailed defendants may plead just to go home As a result a person arrested for a socalled urban disorder offense is likely to get charged with it and to plead guilty to it even if there was no real evidence in the first place This dynamic represents a breakdown in basic principles of justice First arrests are permitted to convert directly into criminal convictions without scrutiny of the facts by prosecutors or defense attorneys Police are not supposed to decide who gets convicted Thats what trials and plea bargaining are for Moreover where arrests themselves are generated not by evidence of crime but by other law enforcement tactics like order maintenance and street sweeps the resulting convictions lack an evidentiary basis Thats a fancy way of saying that defendants are innocentPlea bargains are the root cause of mass incarcerationWagner and Rabuy 17 Wagner Peter and Bernadette Rabuy Mass Incarceration The Whole Pie 2017 Prison Policy Initiative Prison Policy Initiative 14 Mar 2017 wwwprisonpolicyorgreportspie2017html  ABMLWith a sense of the big picture a common followup question might be how many people are locked up for a drug offense We know that almost half a million people are locked up because of a drug offense The data confirms that nonviolent drug convictions are a defining characteristic of the federal prison system but play only a supporting role at the state and local levels While most people in state and local facilities are not locked up for drug offenses most states continued practice of arresting people for drug possession destabilizes individual lives and communities Drug arrests give residents of overpoliced communities criminal records which then reduce employment prospects and increase the likelihood of longer sentences for any future offenses All of the offense data presented comes with an important set of caveats A person in prison for multiple offenses is reported only for the most serious offense so for example there are people in prison for violent offenses who might have also been convicted of a drug offense Further almost all convictions are the result of plea bargains where people plead guilty to a lesser offense perhaps of a different category or one that they may not have actually committed And many of these categories group together people convicted of a wide range of offenses For example murder is generally considered to be an extremely serious offense but murder groups together the rare group of serial killers with people who committed acts that are unlikely for reasons of circumstance or advanced age to ever happen again with offenses that the average American may not consider to be murder at all For example the felony murder rule says that if someone dies during the commission of a felony everyone involved can be as guilty of murder as the person who pulled the trigger Driving a getaway car during a bank robbery where someone was accidentally killed is indeed a serious offense but many may be surprised that this is considered murder This whole pie methodology also exposes some disturbing facts about the youth entrapped in our juvenile justice system Too many youth are there for a most serious offense that is not even a crime For example there are almost 7000 youth behind bars for technical violations of the requirements of their probation rather than for a new offense Further 600 youth are behind bars for status offenses which are behaviors that are not law violations for adults such as running away truancy and incorrigibility Turning finally to the people who are locked up criminally and civilly for immigrationrelated issues we find that 16000 people are in federal prison for criminal convictions of violating federal immigration laws A separate 41000 are civilly detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE separate from any criminal proceedings and are physically confined in federallyrun or privatelyrun immigration detention facilities or in local jails under contract with ICE Notably these categories do not include immigrants represented in other pie slices because of nonimmigration related criminal convictions Now armed with the big picture of how many people are locked up in the United States where and why we have a better foundation for the long overdue conversation about criminal justice reform For example the data makes it clear that ending the War on Drugs will not alone end mass incarceration but that the federal government and some states have effectively reduced their incarcerated populations by turning to drug policy reform Looking at the whole pie also opens up other conversations about where we should focus our energies What is the role of the federal government in ending mass incarceration The federal prison system is just a small slice of the total pie but the federal government can certainly use its financial and ideological power to incentivize and illuminate better paths forward At the same time how can elected sheriffs district attorneys and judges slow the flow of people into the criminal justice system Are state officials and prosecutors willing to rethink both the War on Drugs and the reflexive policies that have served to increase both the odds of incarceration and length of stay for violent offenses Do policymakers and the public have the focus to confront the second largest slice of the pie the thousands of locally administered jails And does it even make sense to arrest millions of poor people each year for minor offenses make them post money bail and then lock them up when they cant afford to pay it Will our leaders be brave enough to redirect corrections spending to smarter investments like communitybased drug treatment and job training Can we implement reforms that both reduce the number of people incarcerated in the US and the wellknown racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system And once we have wrapped our minds around the whole pie of mass incarceration we should zoom out and note that being locked up is just one piece of the larger pie of correctional control There are another 840000 people on parole a type of conditional release from prison and a staggering 37 million people on probation what is typically an alternative sentence Particularly given the often onerous conditions of probation policymakers should be cautious of alternatives to incarceration that can easily widen the net of criminalization to people who are not a threat to public safety Now that we can see the big picture of how many people are locked up in the United States in the various types of facilities we can see that something needs to change Looking at the big picture requires us to ask if it really makes sense to lock up 23 million people on any given day giving this nation the dubious distinction of having the highest incarceration rate in the world Both policymakers and the public have the responsibility to carefully consider each individual slice in turn to ask whether legitimate social goals are served by putting each category behind bars and whether any benefit really outweighs the social and fiscal costs Were optimistic that this whole pie approach can give Americans who are ready for a fresh look at the criminal justice system some of the tools they need to demand meaningful changes to how we do justiceProsecutors stop going after weak cases without plea bargainsGazal 2 Gazal Oren Partial Ban on Plea Bargains University of Michigan University of Michigan 2005 repositorylawumicheducgiviewcontentcgiarticle1052andcontextlaweconarchive  ABMLExceedingly lenient bargains are unique because they signal weak cases A defendant who knows that the probability of acquittal at trial is substantial will only agree to plead guilty in return for an exceedingly lenient bargain56 In stronger cases the prosecutor will not offer exceedingly lenient bargains knowing that the defendant will settle for much less Therefore by comparing the posttrial sentence to the bargained sentence the court can discern information about the strength of the case It may be argued  in the spirit of the arguments against a total ban  that a partial ban would force potentially innocent defendants to face a trial instead of allowing them to plea bargain 57 But unlike the total ban the most substantial effect of the partial ban is not an increase in the rate of trials  it is a change the prosecutors choice of cases With a partial ban in place the prosecutor would not be able to reach a plea agreement in most weak cases At the same time unlike a total ban almost all strong cases would be settled As a result prosecutions of weak cases would cost much more than those of strong cases The prosecutor would have to dismiss multiple strong cases in order to bring charges in one weak case58 This would serve as a substantial incentive against bringing charges in weak cases59 For example assume that the prosecutor can handle either ten settlements or one jury trial within a specific timeframe Assume further that the prosecutor must decide how to proceed with a few strong cases of driving under the influence of alcohol DUI and using Alschulers example60 one very weak rape case The prosecutor can reasonably assume that the rape defendant will plead guilty to a reduced charge that would result in a very lenient sentence but would refuse a more severe sentence because he knows he is very likely to be acquitted at trial If there is no ban on plea bargaining the prosecutor might very well settle the rape case knowing she can still settle nine additional DUI cases In such a system the cost of the weak rape case is similar to the cost of an alternative strong case for a more minor offense If a total ban is imposed the prosecutor has to try each case she chooses to take Thus she can choose one case which can be either one of the misdemeanor cases or the rape case Though the chance of winning the rape case is lower the prosecutor is still likely to prefer this case because a rape conviction is much more significant Therefore a total ban might not be sufficiently effective in encouraging prosecutors to dismiss weak cases However with a partial ban taking the rape case to trial would result in giving up ten DUI guilty pleas And though the prosecutor might pursue the weak rape case at the cost of one strong DUI case she is much less likely to risk a trial in that weak rape case at the cost of ten DUI guilty pleas Therefore a partial ban would result in fewer weak cases and thus in a lower proportion of wrongful convictions than the two alternative systems In fact if a trial is on average ten times more expensive then a guilty plea then a weak case is preferable over a strong one only if the expected convictions value in the weak case is ten times higher than in the strong case Weak cases would suddenly become ten times less attractive then they are without the partial ban making strong cases much more attractive relatively61 And if trials in weak cases are on average more expensive than other trials weak cases might become even less attractiveThe plan is a great idea  empirics Savitsky 12 Savitsky Douglas

the United States prison system Rationality and Society May 30 2012 httpjournalssagepubcomdoipdf1011771043463112441351 Premier  ABML As plea bargainings contribution to prison stratification is a product of both prosecutor choice and defendant bargaining it can be examined from two perspectives using existing datasets First by examining the types of crimes prosecuted before and during the Alaska ban it is possible to test the hypothesis that plea bargaining incentivizes prosecutors to prosecute lowlevel crimes while disincentivizing the prosecution of high level and white collar crime Second to tease out the impact of the defendants bargaining power one can examine modernday US prosecution data and compare initial charges to final disposition to determine whether blacks currently fare worse than whites for the same charges Data collected during the plea bargaining experiment is available in the Alaska Plea Bargaining Study 19741976 Clarke 2005 The dataset divides charged crime into hierarchical categories of severity from Class1 to Class6 Class1 crimes represent the most severe violent crimes ie Savitsky 157 murder and kidnapping Class2 includes other violent felonies Class3 includes such crimes as burglary larceny and receiving Class4 includes less severe property crimes such as the passing of bad checks and fraud Class5 represents drug charges and Class6 represents moral crimes The data indicates a drop in the rate of conviction that is almost entirely attributable to a racial differential The pre and postban rate of conviction for white defendants was unchanged at 53 while the postban rate for nonwhite defendants dropped six percentage points from 55 to 49 Additionally an examination of particular crimes indicates that the decrease in conviction numbers can be largely attributed to decreases in convictions for lower level crimes The proportion of convictions for Class1 and Class2 crimes remained essentially constant each dropping less than a percentage point The proportion of convictions for Class3 crimes increased from 35 to 44 Additionally the proportion of Class4 convictions decreased from 7 to 4 and Class5 convictions decreased from 17 to 12 One would not expect Class1 and Class2 conviction rates to change much as these classes represent the most serious crimes over which prosecutors have the least discretion However for Class3 Class4 and Class5 the crimes where prosecutors do have considerable discretion the convictions moved from lower level crimes to higher level ones This is particularly noteworthy as Alaskas plea bargain ban occurred at the start of the war on drugs yet rather than an escalation in drug prosecution there was actually a decline The racial makeup of the declines in low level convictions is more ambiguous Before the ban nonwhites made up about 22 of those prosecuted for both Class4 and Class5 crimes After the ban this dropped to 13 for Class4 and increased to 26 for Class5 However in both classes the overall conviction rates fell Before the ban nonwhites were convicted of Class4 crimes at a rate of 375 After the ban the rate fell to 125 For Class5 prior to the ban the conviction rate was 48 this fell to 35 after the ban For whites there were also decreases with conviction rates falling from 45 to 33 for Class4 and from 60 to 40 for Class5 Thus during the ban on plea bargaining not only was there a drop in the number of criminal dispositions and conviction rates but the largest reductions in convictions were seen in low level crime It is possible that some of the decreases in lower level crime convictions can be accounted for by charges not being lowered However sentence bargaining and not charge bargaining was the preferred method of plea bargaining before the ban in Alaska Rubinstein and White 1979 which suggests that this explanation is unlikely to be correct According to Carns and Kruse 1991 under the ban there was also a disappearance of racial disparity in the implementation of Alaskas criminal justice system They further note that some attorneys suggested this disappearance was a direct result of the ban In light of such anecdotal evidence in a 1997 report commissioned by the Alaska Supreme Court in order to identify concerns about racial and ethnic bias in the state court system and make recommendations Alaska Court System 1997 the report made the following observation And while the Attorney Generals ban on plea bargaining was credited with eliminating some of the racial disparities found in earlier studies these disparities that may have returned since the ban on plea bargaining was lifted in 1993 The Alaska Legislature should fund a new sentencing study by the Judicial Council Alaska Court System 90 Thus anecdotal evidence suggests that under Alaskas plea bargaining ban racial disparity in the administration of justice seemingly disappeared only to reappear once the state lifted the ban A more direct analysis focused on modern data US Department of Justice 2011 can also help determine whether racial bias currently exists in the plea bargaining system By comparing initial charges brought by prosecutors with bargained for dispositions a differential in plea bargaining power can be revealed In a race neutral criminal justice system that arrested and prosecuted defendants of particular races in proportion to the amount of crime committed by members of those races black and white drug defendants would be expected to plead guilty and be sentenced at similar rates Higher rates of guilty pleas or higher sentences for bargainers from one group would indicate that that group of defendants accepted bargains more readily and that they accept worse deals Misdemeanor convictions

httpsssrncomabstract2010826  ABMLThe legal system devalues misdemeanor convictions It does so explicitly by labeling them petty and by denying various procedural rights62 It also does so implicitly by withholding public resources from the vast misdemeanor process and by tolerating its informality But as these stories reveal the legal economic and psychological impact of a misdemeanor conviction can be substantial First and foremost the individual acquires a criminal record that can follow him or her for a lifetime63 Employers often decline to interview people who have been convicted of any offense 60 to 70 percent of employers state that they would not hire any exoffender and the majority of employers perform background checks64 Because criminal records are easily accessible to employers even a misdemeanor arrest can interfere with an applicants job prospects let alone an actual conviction65 A criminal record also triggers harsher treatment by police prosecutors and courts who are often more lenient towards firsttime offenders and more likely to arrest or charge a person who has a record66 A misdemeanor conviction bars eligibility for numerous professional licenses It can affect child custody food stamp eligibility or lead to deportation67 It can affect the right to vote68 A misdemeanor drug conviction renders students ineligible for federal student loans69 By pleading guilty to disorderly conduct a noncriminal violation a person is presumptively ineligible for New York City public housing for two years70 In Baltimore a misdemeanor conviction renders the person ineligible for public housing for eighteen months A misdemeanor can make it difficult to rent an apartment make the offender ineligible for health care programs72 or land the offender in a sex offender registry73 Fines costs and other economic penalties assessed against misdemeanor defendants have also ballooned becoming an engine of economic disadvantage in their own right and leading some to bemoan the resurrection of debtors prison74 As Bridget McCormack explains in her study of misdemeanor punishments in Michigan Such  economic sanctions include just for example probation oversight fees tether fees drug testing costs police and prosecutor reimbursements and many other costs and fines     In fact in recent years the increasing fines costs and other fees assessed in misdemeanor adjudication have become staggering The total amounts assessed per conviction often not obvious because assessed and accounted for in so many different forms are out of reach for many of the defendants against whom they are assessed75 The failure to pay costs and fines often leads to bench warrants additional penalties and incarceration 76 A misdemeanor conviction can ensure a longer sentence sometimes much longer if a person is convicted of a subsequent crime In Kenneth Nichols case the Supreme Court expressly approved the US Sentencing Guideline practice of enhancing sentences based on prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions77 Since as described below thousands of misdemeanor convictions are uncounseled the use of these convictions in sentencing greatly enhances their systemic impact78 Finally a misdemeanor conviction labels the individual as a criminal not only to employers but to friends family community and him or herself The Supreme Court itself has recognized that misdemeanors impose constitutionally cognizable stigma79 and much has been written about labeling theory as a way of capturing the exclusionary effects of being labeled a criminal80 These dynamics include negative stereotypes the creation of an usthem distinction loss of status and discrimination81 Those labeled criminals may alter their own behavior retreating from mainstream institutions in anticipation of hostile reactions To be sure not all labels are created equal a misdemeanor conviction for loitering is obviously less damning than a felony conviction for robbery But for a person who has been publicly transformed from law abiding citizen into criminal a significant psychosocial line has been crossed82Misdemeanors are the root cause of the racialization of crimeNatapoff 3 Natapoff Alexandra Misdemeanors February 24 2012 85 Southern California Law Review 101 2012 LoyolaLA Legal Studies Paper No 201208 Available at SSRN httpsssrncomabstract2010826  ABMLThe misdemeanor process is the penal systems first formal step259 in what has come to be known as the racialization of crime260 It is here that highvolume convictions of questionable evidentiary validity are generated against young black men precisely that class of defendant who have come to be stereotypically associated with the criminal label While drug enforcement policies are rightly blamed for filling prisons with minority offenders the racialization of crime is broader than the war on drugs Specifically petty convictions formally and permanently label as criminal anyone whom the police choose to discipline through urban order maintenance policies Misdemeanors thus represent the concrete mechanism by which the system is able to generate criminals based on race class and social vulnerability unconstrained by standard evidentiary requirements261 The fact that the bottom of the system is permitted to work this way at all reflects a profound civic disrespect for the subjects of the petty offense process Years ago Justice Powell explained that the presumption of innocence is a constitutional lesson about the limits a free society places on its procedures to safeguard the liberty of its citizens262 The protections of the Bill of Rights are thus a floor of dignity and constitutional protection beneath which no valued citizen should have to sink In the misdemeanor world civic disrespect is expressed precisely through the erosion of these basic protections against wrongful conviction and unjust punishment263 This includes tolerance for weak screening by prosecutors and defense attorneys devaluing the need for evidence and inflicting heavy punishments and disabilities for minor acts Although it has a long racial pedigree this civic disrespect affects many other marginalized groups including the young addicted mentally ill and homeless264 Variously cast as a lack of empathy racial indifference and profound lack of concern265 this indifference permits criminalization without the procedural checks that ensure both accuracy and accountability To take a page from Jonathan Simon insofar as we are governing through crime the politically disfavored lack access to the most robust protective conceptions of legal guilt and process266 In the most concrete sense a single police officers assertion of probable cause is simply not enough to generate a conviction against the favored or the powerful But for poor black and brown petty offenders that is often all it takes At the heart of the racialization of crime lies a particularly pernicious bias that fuels much of the misdemeanor process the lurking suspicion that poor black and brown men are probably guilty even though the vast majority of black people are never arrested or charged with any crime267 This suspicion means that the process need only be enough to confirm guilt rather than perform the kind of rigorous inquiry required by the presumption of innocence268 It is in effect the instantiation of the presumption of guilt in which evidence is required to halt the process of conviction As Lawrence Benner argues in the felony context we now have a system where processing the presumed guilty as cheaply as possible has been made a higher priority than investigating the possibility of innocence269 Such thin process is only intuitively tolerable if we think defendants are probably guilty In something of a vicious circle American cultures association between blackness and criminality generated in large part by the criminal systems own selection processes makes that intuition more plausible The criminal process thus disproportionately stereotypes and targets African American men based in large part on the assumption that they are guilty The misdemeanor view suggests that in fact many of them may be innocent The societal harm to young black men is thus even deeper than the conventional critique supposes First the misdemeanor process widely confers criminal records and personal burdens on potentially innocent people without checking whether they are actually guilty or not Those records and burdens alienate those individuals from the mainstream culture and economy impeding their life options and ironically heightening the chances that they will actually offend270 If they do their minor convictions ensure that the criminal system will treat them even more harshly The misdemeanor gateway is a key ingredient in the criminalization of the black experience First and foremost it confers criminal records with the many penal and economic burdens that a record entails But it is also a pernicious form of education For example the psychological influence that police have over young black men has been well captured in the literature on racial profiling and on black male experiences of the criminal system more generally Writers describe their fear and resentment that police have extensive power over their immediate physical safety and over their futures271 The misdemeanor process is the frontline legal reality out of which this psychological experience springs namely that police actually have relatively unfettered power to formally transform black men into petty criminals regardless of evidence of individual faultMass incarceration leads to prisonsPoon 15 Linda Poon 7302015 How Mass Incarceration Takes a Toll on the

on the property including sewage management and power plants The EPA declined an interview saying only that the agency is carefully reviewing all public comments submitted in regards to the EJ 2020 framework The US prison population has grown dramatically over the past four decades from 200000 adults in 1973 to 15 million by 2009 plus an additional 700000 adults in local jails And with those numbers grew the number of jails detention centers and state and federal prisons Today the nation has more than 5000 such facilities in both cities and rural areas Many are overcrowded presenting serious health concerns for the inmates officers and nearby communities Many also produce waste and pollution far beyond local and federal standards says Tsolkas The Prison Ecology Project is currently raising 15000 to put together a database of the environmental impact of all US correctional facilities Take the facilities at Rikers Island in New York for example In an interview with New York Magazine a corrections officer remarked that Jail has a smell He continued I cant even describe it to you Worse than a sewer Part of the problem is that those facilities were built on top of landfills In the past the island also housed pigs for slaughter as well as copious numbers of rodents which were killed via poison gas according to New York Magazine In 2011 four officers on the island claimed that the toxic chemicals buried beneath the complex along with thick mysterious smoke plumes gave them cancer though the citys lawyer said there was no support for the allegations Then theres the Kern Valley State Prison in California where for years 4800 inmates drank water tainted with arsenic a chemical scientists have linked to cancer In Alabama the rivers bear the brunt of prison overcrowding and inadequate sewage treatment facilities The AP reported in 2006 that facilities in Alabama were dumping nearly twice the amount of allowable raw sewageincluding human waste and toxic chemicalsinto the states waterways endangering both human and aquatic life The Prison Ecology Projects first endeavor is to block a maximumsecurity federal prison from being built on a former

That money is spent on things like beds staff food and facilitiesbut the effects of that incarceration are costly in other ways too according to a new report out Tuesday from the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights The report is a result of a yearlong project that collected information in 14 states through focus groups and surveys My colleague TaNehisi Coates writes extensively about mass incarceration in hisOctober cover story When a someone goes to prison nearly 65 percent of families are suddenly unable to pay for basic needs such as food and housing the report found About 70 percent of those families are caring for children under the age of 18 Women like Smith are often responsible for courtrelated costs associated with the conviction and many families go into debt to pay those fees leaving even less for food and shelter When that family member gets out of jail their loved ones are left with the task of supporting their reentry This burden is ongoing since people with a criminal record often are unable to find work upon their release Poverty in particular perpetuates the cycle of incarceration while incarceration itself leads to greater poverty the report says Going to prison is an increasingly costly proposition In 40 states people facing imprisonment must find the money for things such as attorney fees court fees bond and restitutionthe total costs of which average about 13607 Many defendants choose to pay for private attorneys but even those who dont must pay application fees for public defenders in 43 states which can range from 10 to 480 Fees associated with criminal justice have become a big revenue generator for states but saddle incarcerated people and their families with significant debt Now up to 85 percent of people returning from prison have some sort of criminaljustice debt up from 25 percent in 1991 according to the report The costs dont stop after a trial and conviction Families who try to maintain contact with a prisoner must pay high fees for phone calls from prison The Prison Policy Initiative found that families pay 1 billion annually to call relatives in prison and until 2013 calls could cost 17 for a 15 minutes the FCC cracked down on this and those calls now cost 375 Visiting prisons is also costly for families who must pay for background checks in many states as well as transportation to the facility Onethird of families in the report said they went into debt to pay for visitation or phone calls And whenand ifthe individual is released from prison the costs continue to mount Three in four people surveyed found it difficult to find work after being released from prison and only 40 percent of those surveyed were working fulltime after five years This makes it difficult for onetime prisoners to pay child support or contribute to housing or food costs It also makes it difficult for them to further their education one of the only things that can improve their financial prospectsInequality

apparent rejection of the elites in both America and Britain is surely aimed at me as much as anyone Whatever we might think about the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public to embrace Donald Trump as their next president there is no doubt in the minds of commentators that this was a cry of anger by people who felt they had been abandoned by their leaders It was everyone seems to agree the moment when the forgotten spoke finding their voices to reject the advice and guidance of experts and the elite everywhere I am no exception to this rule I warned before the Brexit vote that it would damage scientific research in Britain that a vote to leave would be a step backward and the electorate  or at least a sufficiently significant proportion of it  took no more notice of me than any of the other political leaders trade unionists artists scientists businessmen and celebrities who all gave the same unheeded advice to the rest of the country What matters now far more than the choices made by these two electorates is how the elites react Should we in turn reject these votes as outpourings of crude populism that fail to take account of the facts and attempt to circumvent or circumscribe the choices that they represent I would argue that this would be a terrible mistake The concerns underlying these votes about the economic consequences of globalisation and accelerating technological change are absolutely understandable The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes with only the most caring creative or supervisory roles remaining This in turn will accelerate the already widening economic inequality around the world The internet and the platforms that it makes possible allow very small groups of individuals to make enormous profits while employing very few people This is inevitable it is progress but it is also socially destructive We need to put this alongside the financial crash which brought home to people that a very few individuals working in the financial sector can accrue huge rewards and that the rest of us underwrite that success and pick up the bill when their greed leads us astray So taken together we are living in a world of widening not diminishing financial inequality in which many people can see not just their standard of living but their ability to earn a living at all disappearing It is no wonder then that they are searching for a new deal which Trump and Brexit might have appeared to represent It is also the case that another unintended consequence of the global spread of the internet and social media is that the stark nature of these inequalities is far more apparent than it has been in the past For me the ability to use technology to communicate has been a liberating and positive experience Without it I would not have been able to continue working these many years past But it also means that the lives of the richest people in the most prosperous parts of the world are agonisingly visible to anyone however poor who has access to a phone And since there are now more people with a telephone than access to clean water in subSaharan Africa this will shortly mean nearly everyone on our increasingly crowded planet will not be able to escape the inequality The consequences of this are plain to see the rural poor flock to cities to shanty towns driven by hope And then often finding that the Instagram nirvana is not available there they seek it overseas joining the ever greater numbers of economic migrants in search of a better life These migrants in turn place new demands on the infrastructures and economies of the countries in which they arrive undermining tolerance and further fuelling political populism For me the really concerning aspect of this is that now more than at any time in our history our species needs to work together We face awesome environmental challenges climate change food production overpopulation the decimation of other species epidemic disease acidification of the oceans Together they are a reminder that we are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity We now have the technology to destroy the planet on which we live but have not yet developed the ability to escape it Perhaps in a few hundred years we will have established human colonies amid the stars but right now we only have one planet and we need to work together to protect it To do that we need to break down not build up barriers within and between nations If we are to stand a chance of doing that the worlds leaders need to acknowledge that they have failed and are failing the many

data from octasbid LD tournaments for the 201415 season via Tabroomcom and coded them along three values whether the Aff or the Neg won whether the decision was unanimous and whether the elim took place before quarterfinals or from quarterfinals on In sum this provided me with a dataset of 216 elimination rounds from the Harvard Bronx Science Glenbrooks Valley HarvardWestlake and St Marks tournaments with the exception of Bronx Science I included data starting with the first full elimso full trips for Harvard but full doubles for Valley despite the occurrence of some runoff rounds prior to that Among these 216 rounds the Affirmative won 98 of them for a winrate of 45 121 of the 216 rounds were unanimous for a unanimityrate of 56 The percentages of specific decision outcomes are listed in the table below To determine whether these outcomes are consistent with each judge randomizing on their individual ballot one must construct an expected set of observations according to the randomization process A naïve randomization might suggest that each judge has a 5050 chance of voting Aff vs Neg on their individual ballot and that therefore the distribution would look something like this In LincolnDouglas however there is a strong suspicion that Negatives win more often than 50 of the time so there is good reason to think that this random hitrate for Neg winning should not be 50 Indeed this advantage for Negatives is present in the analysiss data so we must adjust the expected randomization rate accordingly bear with me here because this will involve a little math Using the aggregate data we can calculate the Neg winrate for these elimination rounds as 547 To win a round as Neg you could either win on a 30 decision or on a 21 decision with three possible combinations of how this 21 could occur depending on which judge sits Accordingly if judges were randomizing their ballots we would need to find a randomization rate for a Negative ballot such that x3  3x21x  0547 which produces an x value of 0531 This math is simpler than it seems About 15 of the time with this randomization rate you would expect a 30 for the Negative and just under 40 of the time it would produce a 21 for the Negative so it combines to the total Neg winrate of 547 So we now know the rate at which each judge should be randomly voting for Neg vs Aff if it were to construct an overall Neg winrate of 547 and using that information we can construct what the expected data for the entire set of outcomes would be Scenario analysis is goodBarma et al 16 Naazneen Barma PhD in Political

Studies Perspectives 17 2 pp 119 May 2016 What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science Scenario analysis is perceived most commonly as a technique for examining the robustness of strategy It can immerse decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional extrapolations of current trends preparing them to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from adverse exogenous shocks The global petroleum company Shell a pioneer of the technique characterizes scenario analysis as the art of considering what if questions about possible future worlds Scenario analysis is thus typically seen as serving the purposes of corporate planning or as a policy tool to be used in combination with simulations of decision making Yet scenario analysis is not inherently limited to these uses This section provides a brief overview of the practice of scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses It then makes a case for the utility of the technique for political science scholarship and describes how the scenarios deployed at NEFPC were created The Art of Scenario Analysis We characterize scenario analysis as the art of juxtaposing current trends in unexpected combinations in order to articulate surprising and yet plausible futures often referred to as alternative worlds Scenarios are thus explicitly not forecasts or projections based on linear extrapolations of contemporary patterns and they are not hypothesisbased expert predictions Nor should they be equated with simulations which are best characterized as functional representations of real institutions or decisionmaking processes Asal 2005 Instead they are depictions of possible future states of the world offered together with a narrative of the driving causal forces and potential exogenous shocks that could lead to those futures Good scenarios thus rely on explicit causal propositions that independent of one another are plausibleyet when combined suggest surprising and sometimes controversial future worlds For example few predicted the dramatic fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014 Yet independent driving forces such as the shale gas revolution in the United States Chinas slowing economic growth and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern oil producers such as Libya were all recognized secular trends thatcombined with OPECs decision not to take concerted action as prices began to declinecame together in an unexpected way While scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic planning during the Cold War the real antecedents of the contemporary practice are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s Raskin et al 2005 Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at Royal Dutch Shell in 1965 with the realization that the usual forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly changing environment in which the company operated Wack 1985 Schwartz 1991 In particular it had become evident that straightline extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating the evolving business environment Shellstyle scenario planning helped break the habit ingrained in most corporate planning of assuming that the future will look much like the present Wilkinson and Kupers 2013 4 Using scenario thinking Shell anticipated the possibility of two Arabinduced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector Building on its corporate roots scenario analysis has become a standard policymaking tool For example the Project on Forward Engagement advocates linking systematic foresight which it defines as the disciplined analysis of alternative futures to planning and feedback loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance challenges Fuerth 2011 Another prominent application of scenario thinking is found in the National Intelligence Councils series of Global Trends reports issued every four years to aid policymakers in anticipating and planning for future challenges These reports present a handful of alternative worlds approximately twenty years into the future carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends risks and opportunities and intended to stimulate thinking about geopolitical change and its effects4 As with corporate scenario analysis the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for longrange general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and coping with more narrow and immediate challenges An example of the latter is the German Marshall Funds EuroFutures project which uses four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euroarea financial crisis German Marshall Fund 2013 Several features make scenario analysis particularly useful for policymaking5 Longterm global trends across a number of different realmssocial technological environmental economic and politicalcombine in oftenunexpected ways to produce unforeseen challenges Yet the ability of decision makers to imagine let alone prepare for discontinuities in the policy realm is constrained by their existing mental models and maps This limitation is exacerbated by wellknown cognitive bias tendencies such as groupthink and confirmation bias Jervis 1976 Janis 1982 Tetlock 2005 The power of scenarios lies in their ability to help individuals break out of conventional modes of thinking and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of trends and deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the future Imagining alternative future worlds through a structured analytical process enables policymakers to envision and thereby adapt to something altogether different from the known present Designing Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry The characteristics of scenario analysis that commend its use to policymakers also make it well suited to helping political scientists generate and develop policyrelevant research programs Scenarios are essentially textured plausible and relevant stories that help us imagine how the future politicaleconomic world could be different from the past in a manner that highlights policy challenges and opportunities For example terrorist organizations are a known threat that have captured the attention of the policy community yet our responses to them tend to be linear and reactive Scenarios that explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of changethe rise of a new peer competitor in the East that diverts strategic attention volatile commodity prices that empower and disempower various state and nonstate actors in surprising ways and the destabilizing effects of climate change or infectious disease pandemicscan be useful for illuminating the nature and limits of the terrorist threat in ways that may be missed by a narrower focus on recognized states and groups By illuminating the potential strategic significance of specific and yet poorly understood opportunities and threats scenario analysis helps to identify crucial gaps in our collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends and dynamics The notion of exogeneityso prevalent in social science scholarshipapplies to models of reality not to reality itself Very simply scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief oftenoverlooked yet pressing questions in international affairs that demand focused investigation Scenarios thus offer in principle an innovative tool for developing a political science research agenda In practice achieving this objective requires careful tailoring of the approach The specific scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to provides a structured experiential process for generating problembased research questions with contemporary international policy relevance6 The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global affairs Consensus was not the goal on the contrary some of these causal statements represented competing theories about global change eg a resurgence of the nationstate vs borderevading globalizing forces A major principle underpinning the transformation of these causal drivers into possible future worlds was to simplify then exaggerate them before fleshing out the emerging story with more details7 Thus the contours of the future world were drawn first in the scenario with details about the possible pathways to that point filled in second It is entirely possible indeed probable that some of the causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so much as to be implausible and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios One of the great strengths of scenario analysis however is that the scenario discussions themselves as described below lay bare these especially implausible claims and systematic biases8 An explicit methodological approach underlies the written scenarios themselves as well as the analytical process around themthat of casecentered structured focused comparison intended especially to shed light on new causal mechanisms George and Bennett 2005 The use of scenarios is similar to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies certain variables in a given situation in order to analyze the resulting effects Fearon 1991 Whereas counterfactuals are traditionally retrospective in nature and explore events that did not actually occur in the context of known history our scenarios are deliberately forwardlooking and are designed to explore potential futures that could unfold As such counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to identifying how individual events might expand or shift the funnel of choices available to political actors and thus lead to different historical outcomes Nye 2005 6869 while forwardlooking scenario analysis can better illuminate surprising intersections and sociopolitical dynamics without the perceptual constraints imposed by finegrained historical knowledge We see scenarios as a complementary resource for exploring these dynamics in international affairs rather than as a replacement for counterfactual analysis historical case studies or other methodological tools In the scenario process developed for NEFPC three distinct scenarios are employed acting as cases for analytical comparison Each scenario as detailed below includes a set of explicit driving forces which represent hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving international affairs The scenario analysis process itself employs templates discussed further below to serve as a graphical representation of a structured focused investigation and thereby as the research tool for conducting casecentered comparative analysis George and Bennett 2005 In essence these templates articulate key observable implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as a framework for capturing the data that emerge King Keohane and Verba 1994 Finally this structured focused comparison serves as the basis for the crosscase session emerging from the scenario analysis that leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas The scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to offer some guidance to policyoriented graduate students who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which political science dissertation ideas are typically developed The initial articulation of a dissertation project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking Useem 1997 Rothman 2008 whereby students might choose topics based on their coursework their own previous policy exposure or the topics studied by their advisors Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking for puzzles in existing research programs Kuhn 1996 Doctoral students also understandably often choose topics that are particularly amenable to garnering research funding Conventional grant programs typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has been important in the recent pastleading to for example the prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid1980s or terrorism studies in the 2000sin the absence of any alternative method for identifying questions of likely future significance The scenario approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the belief that these traditional approaches can be complemented by identifying questions likely to be of great empirical importance in the real world even if these do not appear as puzzles in existing research programs or as clear extrapolations from past events The scenarios analyzed at NEFPC envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium five to seven year term and are designed to tease out issues scholars and policymakers may encounter in the relatively near future so that they can begin thinking critically about them now This timeframe offers a period distant enough from the present as to avoid falling into current events analysis but not so far into the future as to seem like science fiction In imagining the worlds in which these scenarios might come to pass participants learn strategies for avoiding failures of creativity and for overturning the assumptions that prevent scholars and analysts from anticipating and understanding the pivotal junctures that arise in international affairs,
