# Who are the e-debaters?: An analysis of 2020 tournament results

By Peter Zhang

#### Introduction

Since the start of the 2020-2021 season, almost all tournaments have adopted online platforms. This certainly changes how debate works in-round, but there are also reasons to think that this could change *who* competes at tournaments to begin with.

One factor is that location no longer matters: you can compete at an online tournament whether you are in the same county or across the country. Another is that the format rewards debaters with better technology. Finally, other factors like the economic hardship imposed by the pandemic or limitations on school support may also change the composition of the competitor pool.

So, who are the e-debaters? This article takes a quantitative approach to answering that question.

#### Dataset

I examined every tournament held from September to December of 2020 with a bid in LD, as well as their 2019 counterparts. I excluded tournaments that weren't on Tabroom (Sunvite), didn't post entries (Scarvite), or weren't hosted in 2019 (Delores). From these tournaments, I scraped details on Varsity LD entries from Tabroom. Entries who didn't have a posted location were omitted from the geographic analyses. The dataset of entries is available [here](placeholder).

#### Participation

Here are some basic observations about the dataset:

- X debaters competed in an average of X tournaments in 2019; X debaters averaged 2020.
- The total number of entries increased by XX% from 2019 to 2020. 

this should align with intuition: with fewer logistical barriers to competition, we mibht expect this rate to increase

But the increase wasn't even across all tournaments.

case study of alta, UT, and princeton, all held on the weekend of December 6th.





#### Geography







 You can argue about whether the change is a net good or bad, but with the [TOC](https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/index.mhtml?tourn_id=16714) slated to be held virtually, e-debate seems to be here to stay--at least for the rest of the season.
